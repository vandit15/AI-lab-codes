dude

if

i

out
ta
here
...

i
called
on
a
friday
at
12:30
complaining
of
a
severe
toothache
.

dr.
obina
told
me
that
his
office
closed
at
noon
and
that
i
should
call
him
on
monday
.

i
had
been
a
patient
of
dr.
olbina
for
9
years
and
had
spent
thousands
of
dollars
on
crowns
etc
.

there
are
plenty
of
good
dentists
in
fernandina
.

do
n't
go
to
amelia
gentle
dentistry
.

good
location

for
a
hotel
like
this
you
would
expect
some
form
of
free
internet
.

what
you
get
is
a
$
13
/
day
charge
to
access
the
internet
through
a
slow
512
/
512
kb
/
s
that
you
can
only
use
to
check
email
etc
(
read
:
no
downloading
)
.

other
than
that
the
hotel
is
in
a
good
location
and
the
breakfast
is
great

make
you
feel
like
a
number

stay
away
from
kids
first
west
chester
.

you
never
get
a
human
on
the
phone
.

it
's
impossible
to
get
an
appointment
.

if
you
get
caught
in
traffic
and
are
a
couple
minutes
late
they
make
you
re-schedule
...
for
6
weeks
later
.

and
worst
of
all
your
child
feels
like
a
number
not
a
patient
.

go
somewhere
else
.

november

,
2010
first
time
eating
at
caffe
bella
italia
and
it
was
a
wonderful
experience
.

from
the
delectable
antipasto
misto
to
the
spaghetti
alla
barese
and
the
parmigiana
and
ending
with
gelato
,
all
was
mouth
watering
.

too
bad
they
were
out
of
the
chocolate
lava
cake
.

maybe
next
time
they
will
have
it
.

service
was
excellent
!

sandy

beware
of
sharayu

hopless
service
,
at
the
time
of
booking
my
car
a
lot
was
promised
but
delivered
not
even
one
tenth
of
what
was
promised
.

apart
from
that
in
spite
of
my
repeated
attempts
i
could
not
get
in
touch
with
the
manager
to
even
lodge
an
official
complaint
.

my
advise
to
all
is
i
have
fallen
into
this
trap
...
pl
ensure
you
do
nt
!!!

course
has
come
a
long
way
!!

hcc
's
new
nine
was
a
little
shaky
at
first
,
but
the
new
grounds
superintendant
has
done
wonders
for
the
course
!!

the
comment
below
definitely
needs
to
be
retracted
!

come
back
and
give
hcc
a
second
chance
at
least
!

it
is
a
great
course
for
local
golfers
to
be
proud
of
and
all
the
comments
in
2008
have
been
very
positive
!!

excellent
physiotherapists
!

kusal
goonewardena
and
his
team
of
physios
are
unbelievable
!

i
have
been
suffering
from
back
pain
for
over
12
years
and
have
been
to
numerous
specialists
,
physios
,
osteos
and
chiros
with
no
help
.

it
took
the
vigor
team
only
4
visits
to
get
me
feeling
normal
!

and
now
2
months
after
my
last
appointment
i
am
better
than
ever
.

thanks
guys
!

they
must
have
read
these
reviews
and
improved
!

my
husband
and
i
happened
in
on
a
whim
.

we
sat
in
the
front
dining
area
,
it
was
very
cozy
and
pleasant
.

our
server
was
quite
attentive
and
the
food
was
fantastic
.

my
husband
has
been
a
professional
chef
,
so
he
is
a
good
judge
of
quality
food
.

this
was
a
flavorful
,
enjoyable
meal
for
both
of
us
.

rude
rude
rude

went
in
there
and
got
my
dog
groomed
came
home
to
an
uneven
dog
then
took
him
back
to
get
evened
up
what
a
mistake
!

she
did
nt
even
let
me
finish
a
sentence
without
insulting
me
and
telling
me
how
i
should
have
said
it
!

i
wo
nt
go
back
!

she
needs
to
develop
a
personality
!

brought
dog
home
and
it
s
all
choppy
now
!

it
's
helpful
to
know
a
quite
a
bit
about
bull
fighting
.

if
you
watch
a
lot
of
fights
(
youtube
)
and
research
some
of
the
history
(
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bullfighting
)
you
will
find
yourself
enjoying
it
a
lot
more
!

also
after
seeing
a
handful
of
bullfights
,
i
can
say
that
they
're
a
lot
more
enjoyable
if
you
're
smashed
(
bac
>=
.15
)
.

all
i
can
say
is
that
i
am
glad
i
went
in
!

the
nurses
are
sweet
as
pie
and
the
doctor
is
wonderful
.

this
place
is
about
healing
,
not
making
a
buck
.

the
followup
visit
is
free
!!

after
going
to
the
hospital
and
paying
er
prices
...
there
is
no
way
i
wo
n't
be
back
here
!!

i
will
be
back
and
telling
everyone
about
this
clinic
.

thank
you
!!

i
just
like
the
fact
that
he
was
able
to
do
the
specific
type
of
repair
i
wanted
(
a
reball
)
and
give
me
the
longest
warranty
and
even
a
lower
price
.

someone
else
i
found
that
said
they
could
do
it
but
wanted
to
charge
me
more
and
give
me
less
warranty
.

it
was
a
no
brainer
really
.

i
choose
console
pros
and
i
'm
happy
i
did
.

this
place
is
bad
.

it
's
dark
,
dingy
&
dirty
.

the
salads
are
limp
and
the
rest
of
the
food
is
n't
any
better
(
ok
,
the
nachos
are
not
too
bad
!
)

this
place
may
have
been
something
sometime
;
but
it
way
past
it
"
sell
by
date
"
.

i
have
eaten
here
twice
in
the
past
year
and
will
not
go
back
and
can
not
recommend
it
.

ham
s
on
friendly
...
rip

this
is
the
original
ham
's
restaurant
,
expanded
into
a
regional
chain
in
the
late
80's
--
but
this
one
is
no
more
.

victim
of
hard
times
and
i
suspect
failing
corporate
management
.

according
to
news
accounts
,
the
company
is
struggling
.

i
have
many
fond
memories
of
my
college
evenings
there
long
ago
.

so
long
ham
s
...
you
will
be
missed
.

we
are
very
pleased
with
the
services
of
first
glass
window
.

our
window
panes
were
so
dirty
that
they
needed
a
specialist
to
come
and
clean
them
.

we
called
few
companies
before
we
decide
to
hire
them
.

they
came
on
time
and
completed
their
work
quickly
.

we
were
very
happy
how
clean
looked
our
windows
.

if
you
have
some
problems
with
your
windows
,
you
should
call
them
.

great
help
even
near
closing
time
!

i
came
in
to
town
for
a
week
and
forgot
my
trainers
!

oh
no
!!

i
came
in
30
min
before
close
and
the
staff
was
super
helpful
.

they
spent
a
lot
of
time
with
me
and
got
me
into
a
great
pair
of
shoes
.

i
think
they
may
even
be
better
than
the
pair
i
have
been
using
this
past
year
!

thanks
run
on
!

great

this
is
a
perfect
place
to
get
your
hair
done
.

i
have
gone
there
time
and
time
again
whenever
i
need
to
get
my
hair
done
or
when
i
want
a
haircut
.

when
i
get
my
hair
done
there
,
they
use
enough
hairstyling
products
while
it
does
not
ruin
your
hair
.

the
service
is
great
and
during
weekends
it
tends
to
get
busy
,
but
the
wait
is
worthwhile
.

highly
recommend

i
have
worked
with
shannon
as
my
massage
therapist
and
intuitive
bodyworker
for
years
and
have
never
been
disappointed
.

no
matter
what
state
i
am
in
when
i
arrive
,
i
always
leave
feeling
better
.

she
has
not
only
helped
me
through
some
challenging
computer
-
work
and
sports
related
injuries
,
she
was
wonderful
to
work
with
throughout
my
pregnancy
and
beyond
.

i
highly
recommend
her
.

best
store
in
boothbay
harbor

what
a
fantastic
store
,
i
love
this
place
.

not
the
same
old
stuff
that
all
the
other
stores
have
.

their
items
are
very
unique
,
great
quality
,
great
prices
.

they
also
have
the
best
tea
i
ever
had
,
not
at
all
like
the
junk
you
get
at
the
grocery
stores
,
i
stock
up
when
ever
there
because
they
are
closed
in
the
winter
.

the
best

dr.
aster
and
her
team
have
been
a
strong
advocate
in
the
health
of
both
my
daughters
.

dr.
aster
is
very
kind
an
gentle
with
the
children
,
but
also
positive
and
to
the
point
with
the
parents
.

she
is
and
excellent
doctor
to
have
on
one
's
team
.

even
though
i
live
pretty
far
from
her
office
i
still
make
the
trip
so
my
daughters
will
have
the
best
!

my
wife
and
i
avoided
doing
some
fairly
simple
electrical
re-wiring
in
our
home
for
several
years
due
to
overall
hassle
and
cost
involved
.

i
finally
called
matt
from
bonafide
and
he
made
the
project
both
easy
for
us
and
reasonable
.

he
was
prompt
,
knowledgable
,
friendly
,
clean
and
just
an
overall
great
guy
who
obviously
cares
about
his
business
.

i
will
reccommend
his
services
however
/
whenever
possible
!

real
pros

i
've
had
writer
friends
describe
horror
stories
with
their
printers
.

i
tell
them
:
why
not
just
go
with
these
guys
?

richard
joule
and
the
gang
are
pros
from
start
to
finish
.

they
set
out
to
exceed
your
expectations
.

already
i
'm
considering
future
projects
,
and
i
can
assure
you
that
for
my
printing
needs
i
will
be
choosing
no
other
than
atlanta
paperback
book
printing
.

i
have
been
here
3
times
and
all
3
times
it
has
been
bad
!

they
have
messed
up
my
order
and
....
the
food
was
just
not
good
!

i
had
sonic
in
many
other
palces
but
for
some
reason
this
sonic
is
always
just
covered
in
grease
and
not
good
...
:(

i
hope
they
get
there
act
together
...

i
am
going
to
give
it
one
last
chance
in
next
few
months
and
see
??

i
called
them
for
an
estimate
and
they
insulted
me
when
i
ask
them
questions
.

they
are
very
rude
and
nasty
.

please
do
n't
use
this
moving
company
if
you
do
n't
want
to
:
cry
,
have
trouble
and
a
bad
experience
on
the
day
of
your
move
.

they
will
give
you
a
low
price
over
the
phone
and
on
the
day
of
your
move
they
will
change
the
price
,
i
guarantee
it
.

you
've
got
maids
did
a
fabulous
job
cleaning
my
home
.

i
am
hiring
them
to
come
once
a
week
now
that
they
got
my
house
to
where
they
can
maintain
it
for
only
an
hour
and
a
half
every
two
weeks
!

satisfactory
for
sure
with
the
sercvice
!

beats
having
one
"
cleaning
lady
"
who
took
twice
as
long
and
did
not
do
a
very
through
job
like
the
"
maids
"
did
!

this
place
has
the
best
baby
and
children
s
clothes
.

especially
high
end
keep
sake
sort
of
clothing
that
you
just
ca
nt
find
in
a
lot
of
stores
.

it
is
all
very
unique
and
you
wo
nt
find
any
other
baby
wearing
the
same
stuff
.

i
spent
quite
a
bit
because
i
spoil
my
little
princess
.

after
all
she
will
only
be
a
baby
for
so
long
i
figure
why
not
enjoy
it
.

i
would

,
there
is
a
dip
in
the
center
of
each
nail
.

i
also
had
a
pedicure
,
and
they
cut
my
nails
too
short
,
one
of
my
big
toes
looks
like
it
s
getting
infected
.

no
way
.

i
'm
certainly
no
expert
on
asian
food
in
fact
not
even
a
lover
of
vietnamese
food
but
i
wanted
to
try
the
real
things
here
at
a
dong
.

cold
,
slimy
,
tasteless
however
is
the
same
in
all
languages
and
foods
.

not
good
,
not
great
,
and
again
another
disappointment
in
central
iowa
.

how
do
these
places
stay
in
business
.

this
town
needs
some
food
soul
and
this
is
not
it
.

worth
every
penny

my
girlfriend
and
i
ate
at
the
grill
last
night
,
and
our
experience
was
amazing
.

everything
we
ordered
was
prepared
to
perfection
,
and
was
presented
perfectly
.

the
asparagus
,
seared
tuna
,
and
lobster
tail
were
the
best
we
ever
had
.

then
the
desserts
came
,
and
they
were
hands
down
the
best
dessert
we
ever
had
.

i
will
sum
it
up
with
,
it
was
worth
every
penny
!

best
chinese
restaurant
ever
!!!

it
was
the
best
chinese
food
i
have
ever
had
.

all
the
food
tasted
excellent
,
and
with
the
new
renovation
of
chairs
and
the
bathroom
,
it
is
awesome
.

the
people
working
their
are
also
extremely
polite
and
friendly
.

every
time
i
go
,
kevin
,
the
manager
,
will
always
remember
my
family
and
i
.

overall
,
it
is
very
family
oriented
,
and
i
recommend
it
to
everyone
!!!

tiger

i
had
john
and
dustin
working
feverishly
to
get
my

these

were
absolutely
professional
.

john
was
here
in
45
minutes
after
i
called
on
a
10

early
sunday
morning
.

if
you
need
someone
to
help
you
out
with
your
heating
problems
,
i
definitely
would
call
tiger

absolutely
a

and
i
thank
you

professional
and
inspiring

nigel
from
nidd
design
has
always
provided
a
first
class
service
,
from
his
advice
and
professionalism
to
the
quality
of
his
design
drawings
and
planning
applications
.

his
knowledge
and
expertise
help
smooth
the
way
with
any
planning
application
,
ensuring
compliance
with
the
building
regulations
.

once
you

nigel
you
will
not
want
to
work
with
anyone
else
.

he
really
does
turn
your
dreams
into
reality
for
your
home
!

we
came
at
around
730
and
they
close
at
8
and
wanted
to
try
the
specials
but
they
were
out
for
the
day
so
i
would
say
go
way
before
they
close
.

got
the
crab
rangoon
which
was
great
,
tofu
with
cabbage
which
was
spicy
but
good
and
shrimp
satay
which
was
also
good
.

def
going
to
come
back
and
try
this
place
again
.

bea
was
really
nice
and
asked
how
the
food
was
.

cute
place
also

as
a
native
southern
californian
i
can
tell
you
that
this
is
not
authentic
mexican
food
.

however
,
i
still
like
this
place
a
lot
.

esp.
the
mole
,
tortilla
soup
,
and
guacamole
.

margaritas
are
alright
.

my
only
complaint
is
the
queso
.

it
used
to
be
fabulous
,
why
did
you
guys
change
it
??

queso
should
not
be
watery
:(
.....

***
update
***
never
mind
!

they
fixed
the
queso
!

thank
you
thank
you

had
the

the

and
the

did

good
.
at
all
.

in
fact
my
friend
vomited
after
our
meal
.

maybe
we
ordered
the
wrong
dish
but
my
experience
here
was
poor
.

service
was
okay
not
great
,
we
came
for
a
late
lunch

i
do
n't

small
firm
with
great
service

bloom
legal
was
really
attentive
to
my
problem
,
and
seth
bloom
took
the
time
to
help
me
understand
the
legal
issue
i
was
dealing
with
.

i
much
preferred
the
one
-
on
-
one
service
here
to
the
experiences
i
've
had
with
bigger
offices
and
firms
.

while
i
hope
i
do
n't
have
any
need
for
a
lawyer
anytime
soon
,
if
i
do
i
'll
definitely
use
this
firm
again
.

used
their
service
for
the
first
time
and
was
immediately
impressed
by
their
professionalism
(
received
a
phone
call
soon
after
order
was
placed
to
confirm
details
)
and
the
subsequent
delivery
of
my
gift
(
to
split
,
croatia
)
was
as
requested
.

the
gift
itself
was
exactly
as
described
and
pictured
in
the
catalogue
and
of
the
highest
standard
.

would
highly
recommend
to
anyone

love
my
gym
!

fitness

is
a
second
home
to
a
lot
of
us
gym
members
who
work
out
daily
.

if
you
are
serious
about
working
out
in
a
non-commercial
like
atmosphere
then
you
have
chosen
the
best
place
to
be
.

this
is
the
most
humble

do
n't
be

when
you
see
how
addicting
going
to
fitness

can
be

over-rated
...

this
restaurant
is
over-rated
.

it
is
hard
to
find
...
and
the
mexican
food
is
bland
,
almost
equivalent
to
eating
out
of
a
can
.

the
service
is
poor
...

i
asked
for
a
fried
egg
on
my
enchiladas
...
and
did
not
get
it
.!

secondly
,
the
enchladas
did
not
come
with
enchilada
sauce
..
but
chili
...
like
hormel
's
chili
..
the
cheese
was
american
cheese
!

the
chili
relleno
..
had
no
batter
on
it
.

i
googled
restaurants
in
the
area
and
fuji
sushi
came
up
and
reviews
were
great
so
i
made
a
carry
out
order
of
:
l
17
.

mixed
tempura
.....................
8.25
shrimp
or
vegetable
tempura
&
salad
.

i
was
very
happy
with
the
customer
service
and
even
more
please
with
the
portion
size
,
to
go
box
set
up
and
quality
of
the
food
for
the
price
.

i
'm
very
happy
and
will
definitely
dine
in
and
carry
out
again
.

good
pizza
at
a
good
price

i
just
moved
nearby
and
have
tried
several
of
the
local
places
,
this
was
the
first
one
and
i
should
have
just
stuck
with
it
.

the
pizza
is
usually
pretty
good
,
the
only
bad
one
we
got
was
on
a
friday
night
and
it
just
needed
to
be
cooked
a
little
more
,
but
it
was
still
good
.

their
bbq
chicken
pizza
is
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
ever
had
.

horrible
service
!!!

absolute
horrible
service
from
the
parts
department
.

they
are
very
rude
over
the
phone
and
in
person
.

they
talk
down
to
you
like
they
are
supreme
beings
,
if
you
hate
your
job
so
much
then
quit
!!

how
these
guys
can
get
away
with
being
so
rude
with
people
is
mind
blowing
.

i
will
never
do
business
with
sun
toyota
again
.

thank
god
there
are
plenty
of
toyota
dealerships
to
choose
from
in
this
city
.

this
is
a
good
place

i
have
been
here
before
and
the
service
was
absoulutely
great
.

they
had
a
great
selection
of
colors
to
choose
from
and
their
seats
are
super
comfty
.

i
enjoy
going
there
although
i
've
only
been
there
once
,
i
will
be
returning
toda
to
recieve
a
pair
of
french
tips
and
i
will
only
go
to
the
best
and
to
me
the
best
is
here
.

i
reccomend
you
to
go
and
enjoy
their
wonderful
hospitality
.

anna
marie
and
govind
are
very
sweet
people
,
and
the
minute
you
steep
into
their
school
,
the
calm
loving
atmosphere
takes
over
,
and
tension
and
worries
stay
outside
in
the
street
,
whether
or
not
you
pick
them
up
again
after
class
is
probably
a
question
of
practice
.

a
wonderful
place
,
if
you
want
more
than
just
the
physical
side
of
yoga
.

give
yourself
the
gift
of
trying
this
place
,
to
see
if
it
fits
you
...

they
do
n't
seem
to
be
interested
in
selling
cars
.

went
there
yesterday
:
we
are
trying
to
decide
between
two
different
honda
models
,
so
we
wanted
to
test
-
drive
both
back
to
back
.

the
salesperson
refused
!

claimed
he
was
too
busy
for
two
test
drives
.

we
were
the
only
customers
there
!

do
n't
waste
time
,
just
drive
10
minutes
more
down
to
stevens
creek
,
they
actually
do
try
to
help
their
customers
there
!

ate
here
a
couple
times
.

it
is
not
a
high
end
steak
house
,
more
of
the
cuisine
brett
enjoys
in
mississippi
.

so
,
if
you
want
a
burger
and
fries
,
well
,
it
is
ok
.

if
you
want
a
little
cajunish
food
-
it
is
good
.

if
you
want
a
steak
,
well
,
this
is
not
the
best
in
green
bay
.

overall
decent
but
if
you
are
expecting
a
ruth
chris
type
steak
,
this
is
not
it
.

eulogic

good
place
to
be
on
a
sunday
night
.

the
beers
were
good
,
nice
choice
of
beers
as
well
,
and
as
usual
the
mussels
were
great
,
the
place
upstairs
is
a
nice
addition
to
the
bar
downstairs
.

filled
up
on
too
much
beer
and
hence
can
not
comment
on
the
food
.

but
the
menu
had
standard
stuff
that
one
would
get
at
a
belgian
tavern
.

if
you
are
a
handcraft
beer
person
,
this
is
a
fantastic
place
to
be
.

perfect
location
plus

i
moved
into
the
tanglewood
apartments
in
late
2008
and
it
's
been
a
refreshing
change
.

i
used
to
live
at
meadowrun
and
that
was
a
nightmare
.

the
manager
-
tiffany
-
is
actually
very
nice
so
i
'm
a
bit
surprised
by
other
comments
.

she
's
very
reachable
and
she
has
always
responded
quickly
to
any
questions
or
requests
.

plus
she
plans
a
monthly
breakfasts
and
other
events
at
the
clubhouse
which
is
a
nice
added
benefit
.

great
service
/
deals
-
support
this
local
business

i
have
used
these
guys
for
new
snows
,
fixing
lots
of
flats
,
used
replacement
tires
,
and
oil
changes
.

they
have
the
best
prices
locally
and
good
customer
service
.

one
guy
is
a
little
surley
,
but
who
gives
a
crap
as
long
as
your
car
's
work
is
outstanding
.

and
they
're
usually
able
to
help
you
as
a
walk
-
in
,
and
they
're
fast
.

overall
-
good
stuff
.

another
great
business
bites
the
dust
!

the
best
cakes
ever
!

a
bit
pricey
,
so
i
did
n't
go
very
often
,
but
it
was
always
a
treat
when
i
did
.

the
prices
were
worth
what
i
got
.

i
'm
assuming
they
are
completely
out
of
business
since
i
ca
n't
find
any
contact
information
.

i
'm
hoping
the
bakers
continue
to
do
their
baking
out
of
another
place
,
because
it
would
be
a
shame
not
to
have
these
cakes
any
longer
.

super
nice
people
,
really
good
food

what
i
love
most
about
this
place
,
other
than
the
food
,
is
that
eating
here
makes
you
feel
like
you
're
in
a
small
town
rather
than
baltimore
.

the
owners
are
really
nice
,
they
serve
good
food
at
a
good
price
,
and
the
option
to
eat
outside
on
the
deck
(
esp
on
the
weekend
whether
there
is
hardly
any
traffic
)
is
great
.

one
of
my
top
5
places
to
eat
in
baltimore
.

overpriced

this
place
is
identical
to
the
youngstown
sports
grille
,
so
i
imagine
they
are
owned
/
operated
by
the
same
people
.

the
food
is
mediocre
at
best
,
and
largely
overpriced
given
the
portion
size
and
quality
.

do
n't
even
get
me
started
on
how
expensive
it
is
to
drink
there
.

i
have
ate
here
3
times
since
they
first
opened
,
and
the
service
has
been
poor
each
time
,
the
staff
always
comes
across
as
somewhat
rude
and
slow
.

enjoyed
this
cozy
little
spot
with
a
group
of
8
folks
.

service
was
excellent
.

food
was
excellent
.

wine
was

i
was
feeling
the
need
for
some
fish
so
i
had
the
salmon
which
was
very
good
but
the
steaks
looked
amazing
and
if
i
am
in
town
again
,
i
'll
definitely
order
a
steak
.

a
perfect
place
for
a
romantic
dinner
.

lots
of
"
pretty
people
"
dining
inside
.

great
staff
.

very
helpful
!!!!

they
interviewed
me
,
gave
me
tests
in
the
software
i
included
on
my
resume
,
and
placed
me
in
a
position
that
i
kept
for
several
years
.

re-interviewed
and
am
going
on
interviews
for
a
new
job
.

i
'm
really
thankful
for
the
folks
at
hr
office
.

they
are
dependable
,
have
great
connections
in
the
community
,
and
are
a
great
resource
for
finding
a
job
.

i
highly
recommend
them
to
all
of
my
friends
!!!!
!

great
experience
-
consider
checking
out
their
puppies
before
buying
from
a
breeder
!

i
adopted
a
3.5
month
old
yellow
lab
last
winter
from
the
dumb
friends
league
.

the
staff
was
very
helpful
in
finding
the
right
dog
for
me
and
the
care
my
pup
received
was
outstanding
.

if
you
are
on
the
lookout
for
a
pure
breed
pup
do
n't
forget
to
check
out
the
shelters
!

my
pup
has
a
wonderful
temperment
and
has
been
a
wonderful
addition
to
my
family
!

food
good
,
service
poor

no
silverware
,
asked
for
a
spoon
for
my
son
s
mac
and
cheese
ended
up
having
to
use
my
tea
spoon
.

asked
for
bar
-
b
-
que
sauce
never
got
it
.

never
checked
back
with
us
once
we
got
our
food
.

had
to
go
the
the
bus
boy
s
station
ourselves
to
get
napkins
.

only
one
server
,
too
buys
talking
with
others
i
guess
.

food
was
good
,
but
service
means
a
lot
to
me
.

dr.
chao
you
are
the
best
dentist
i
have
ever
had
.

you
are
knowledgeable
,
professional
,
gentel
and
kind
.

i
wish
i
had
you
as
my
dentist
early
on
in
my
life
-
maybe
my
teeth
would
have
been
a
lot
better
then
they
are
now
,
however
i
am
glad
you
are
my
dentist
now
.

even
though
you
are
expensive
.

thank
you
for
helping
to
preserve
my
teeth
.

you
are
meticulous
in
your
work
and
it
shows
in
my
smile
.

con
garage

i
brought
my
car
in
for
a
simple
emissions
test
.

i
guess
they
figured
me
for
an
easy
mark
,
and
tried
to
explain
that
my
car
would
n't
pass
unless
i
replaced
a
hose
.

ten
minutes
later
,
i
took
my
car
down
the
street
and
it
passed
the
emissions
test
with
flying
colors
.

if
you
're
a
fan
of
herpes
,
being
ripped
off
,
and
child
molesters
,
this
is
the
garage
for
you
.

if
not
,
go
somewhere
else
.

rude
service

even
though
i
have
never
tried
hoa
salon
but
i
agree
with
other
reviewers
that
they
are
rude
.

i
called
and
asked
about
the
price
for
hair
updo
and
the
receptionist
or
owner
who
aswered
the
phone
refused
to
tell
me
,
or
even
just
give
me
an
approximate
price
range
.

he
told
us
to
stop
by
the
salon
and
then
he
will
tell
us
the
price
.

what
kind
of
rude
service
is
that
?

i
do
n't
want
to
waste
my
time
with
them
.

top
notch
eats
!

so
here
we
are
in
manson
.

manson
?

yes
,
manson
.

right
near
chelan
.

aka
nowheresville
.

and
this
litttle
gem
of
a
7
-
table
restaurant
is
a
complete
and
utterly
wonderful
surprise
.

a
short
but
wide
-
ranging
menu
executed
with
innovative
perfection
in
a
cozy
hole
in
the
wall
just
off
the
main
street
.

fantastic
food
served
without
pretense
,
very
reasonably
priced
wine
selections
.

a
great
place
to
go
for
dinner
after
a
day
of
wine
tasting
.

excellent
service
and
reasonable
prices

boutique
stores
dealing
in
children
's
clothing
/
gifts
are
often
outrageously
priced
(
who
wants
to
pay
40
dollars
for
a
newborn
onesie
?
)

but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
that
the
purple
goose
's
prices
are
reasonable
(
for
the
same
products
found
at
other
area
boutiques
,
the
prices
were
20
-
25
%
cheaper
)
.

the
service
was
also
excellent
-
friendly
,
helpful
and
informative
without
being
overbearing
.

will
definitely
return
.

consistantly
poor

a
lack
of
organisation
,
coupled
with
the
distain
for
its
customers
,
makes
this
the
worst
rental
agency
i
have
used
.

chasing
them
on
issues
from
the
day
i
moved
in
(
many
of
them
still
unresolved
as
i
left
)
to
all
sorts
of
farcical
issues
with
funds
,
after
i
left
.
.
.
.
as
soon
as
i
could
.

if
you
must
use
them
,
be
vigilant
and
be
ready
to
push
,
if
you
can
go
elsewhere
then
i
would
.

amazing
night
-
great
party
spot
!!

went
to
the
willow
lounge
this
past
weekend
for
dinner
and
drinks
...
place
is
awesome
.

had
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
a
/
c
broke
,
i
feel
bad
it
was
their
opening
!

anyway
,
once
that
is
fixed
,
this
place
will
be
amazing
.

drinks
were
awesome
,
prices
reasonable
,
and
staff
friendly
.

this
is
an
awesome
date
spot
that
the
area
seriously
needs
.

check
out
the
willow
lounge
,
you
ll
be
happy
!

it
s
been
a
few
years
since
i
have
been
to
ipanema
.

but
my
wife
and
i
first
went
there
thinking
it
would
be
brazilian
food
(
think
lots
of
meat
)
,
but
it
turned
out
to
be
a
vegan
restaurant
!

and
,
i
can
say
,
this
was
one
of
my
favorite
places
to
eat
in
all
of
richmond
.

amazing
!

do
n't
let
the
nondescript
building
entrance
fool
you
,
these
are
some
creative
and
talented
chefs
...
two
thumbs
way
,
way
up
!

excellent
food
,
fantastic
wait
staff

i
recently
threw
a
surprise
birthday
party
for
my
wife
at
fraiser
's
.

we
had
30
guests
for
the
event
,
and
everyone
came
away
from
the
evening
impressed
with
not
only
the
food
,
but
the
outstanding
service
as
well
.

the
management
was
easy
to
deal
with
during
the
planning
stages
,
and
the
execution
by
the
kitchen
and
wait
staff
was
flawless
.

i
highly
recommend
fraiser
's
for
anyone
planning
a
special
event
for
friends
,
family
or
business
.

fantastic
store
!!!

i
came
upon
this
store
as
the
building
caught
my
eye
.

it
's
located
in
the
huge
honka
log
homes
building
,
by
walmart
off
of
evergreen
parkway
.

the
store
was
decorated
with
furnishings
&
accessories
.

the
friendly
crew
working
was
great
&
very
helpful
.

this
store
is
what
colorado
is
all
about
.

also
,
i
purchased
some
furniture
last
year
and
all
has
been
great
!

it's
durability
&
look
was
perfect
and
i
will
definitely
be
adding
to
my
collection
soon
!

lovely
people
,
great
hats

i
was
saddened
to
see
the
reviews
that
claimed
world
hats
mart
has
poor
service
.

it
led
me
to
believe
that
the
reviewers
simply
had
difficulty
tolerating
people
with
strongly
-
accented
english
.

the
husband
and
wife
who
run
this
spot
are
lovely
people
.

we
have
had
many
conversations
with
them
and
they
have
always
been
extremely
patient
with
me
as
i
tried
on
multiple
hats
in
search
of
the
right
costumes
for
my
magic
act
.

i
recommend
them
highly
!

do
nt
ever
go
there
,
not
even
if
your
car
flips
.

their
service
sucks
to
start
off
with
,
people
are
cruel
and
ignorant
.

i
'm
compeltly
dissatisfied
with
their
service
and
their
products
.

they
do
not
have
a
return
policy
and
even
if
their
product
sucks
,
they
will
not
take
it
back
!

do
not
ever
go
here
.

i
prefer
advanced
auto
parts
over
this
crappy
place
with
the
meanest
people
.

and
they
thrive
to
get
a
customer
.

do
not
go
here
..
thank
you

horrible

i
have
been
growing
my
hair
out
for
1
year
plus
and
went
in
to
get
1
inch
taken
off
.

i
walked
out
with
5
inch
long
hair
on
the
top
,
2
inch
long
hair
on
the
sides
,
and
1.5
in
the
back
.

my
hair
is
uneven
and
it
looks
rediculous
.

this
woman
should
be
working
in
supercuts
...
if
that
.

this
was
a
terrible
experience
and
i
hope
that
no
one
else
goes
through
that
.

do
your
self
a
favor
and
do
not
go
to
this
establishment
.

the
worst
burger
king
restaurant
!!!

i
generally
like
the
bk
over
the
other
fast
serving
restaurants
;
however
,
i
regreted
to
visit
this
restaurant
at
my
town
.

this
is
a
shame
of
my
adorable
town
,
branford
.

i
ordered
a
kid
meal
with
a
milk
and
found
a
bottle
was
half
opened
already
.

i
asked
them
to
change
it
but
they
rudely
said
that
it
was
okay
.

disgusting
french
fries
is
very
best
menu
.

do
n't
go
,
or
you
will
learn
how
to
waste
your
money
.

disappointed

the
bad
:
i
was
at
napa
recently
and
was
unpleasantly
surprised
at
poor
waiter
svce
and
subpar
food
.

we
were
a
party
of
4
and
none
of
us
were
particularly
pleased
with
our
dishes
.

napa
is
all
about
wine
but
gives
very
short
descriptions
of
the
wines
on
their
lists
.

i
found
my
initial
selection
satisfactory
but
the
wine
flight
we
chose
to
be
poorly
composed
.

if
you
must
go
ask
lots
of
questions
about
your
selections
since
your
expectations
may
as
high
as
mine
were
.

highly
recommended

we
walked
in
to
pick
our
little
man
at
10
minutes
to
closing
and
heard
laughter
from
kids
and
the
staff
.

the
facilities
are
more
than
adequate
and
the
staff
are
just
phenomenal
.

their
sense
of
humour
and
calmness
when
dealing
with
the
little
ones
amazes
me
every
time
i
walk
in
.

we
have
since
moved
slightly
further
away
from
the
centre
but
it
's
worth
the
extra
travel
,
as
the
care
provided
exceeds
our
expectations
...
especially
after
a
few
horrendous
daycare
experiences
elsewhere
.

horrible
!!!!
!

this
has
to
be
some
of
the
worst
pizza
i
have
ever
had
the
misfortune
of
ordering
.

the
crust
was
lopsided
,
thicker
on
one
side
than
the
other
.

it
actually
had
a
hole
in
one
of
the
slices
.

there
was
minimal
cheese
and
sauce
and
it
completely
lacked
flavor
.

i
know
new
york
pizza
and
this
is
not
it
!!

this
was
nothing
like
new
york
style
pizza
!!!.

i
love
pizza
and
this
was
a
complete
and
utter
disappointment
!!

i
would
not
suggest
this
pizza
to
anyone
!!!

best
quote
ever
my
gate
was
stuck
halfway
open
so
i
called
a
class
garage
doors
dr
services
.

they
came
to
my
house
in
no
time
and
started
working
on
the
gate
.

they
were
very
friendly
and
were
able
to
explain
me
exactly
what
was
wrong
with
it
.

once
they
fixed
it
they
answetred
all
of
my
questions
with
no
hesitations
and
then
gave
me
the
best
quote
ever
.

i
know
that
if
my
garage
door
needs
to
be
repaired
,
i
will
be
calling
a
class
garage
doors

you
will
be
happy
at
this
store
!

allen
tire
was
recommended
by
friend
after
my
having
bad
tire
experiences
in
temecula
.

the
store
manager
,
jim
smith
,
made
an
excellent
tire
recommendation
for
my
newly
acquired
lexus
.

tires
were
the
right
price
and
now
the
car
feels
like
it
is
riding
on
rails
around
turns
.

the
store
is
clean
,
run
very
professionally
and
a
pleasure
to
be
in
.

they
know
their
job
and
you
do
not
have
to
watch
them
to
be
sure
everything
is
done
right
.

easiest
time
i
ever
had
purchasing
a
car
!

excellent
service
,
not
only
did
they
get
the
exact
car
i
wanted
win
in
48
hours
but
the
sales
man
also
took
me
out
to
lunch
.

very
kind
and
reliable
.

i
highly
recommend
this
dealership
if
you
would
not
like
to
hassle
on
price
and
receive
friendly
service
.

i
have
since
purchased
two
cars
from
this
dealership
,
the
first
one
was
from
phillip
and
the
second
was
from
richard
.

both
were
excellent
sales
men
who
put
my
needs
first
.

this
place
has
done
a
great
job
of
taking
care
of
the
usual
maintenance
on
my
hooptie
.

i
also
never
have
to
wait
long
for
a
yearly
inspection
sticker
...
and
never
get
the
usual
excuses
other
shops
always
gave
me
...
"
the
inspection
guy
is
n't
here
today
"
....
for
example
.

today
i
went
into
kwik
kar
and
there
were
two
cars
in
front
of
me
for
inspection
...
but
i
was
still
out
of
there
pretty
quick
...
barely
had
time
to
read
a
chapter
in
my
book
.

extremely
helpful
and
professional

as
first
-
time
home
buyers
,
my
husband
and
i
found
stephanie
fairchild
at
prudential
steamboat
realty
,
extremely
helpful
.

she
worked
with
us
for
over
a
year
,
helping
us
find
our
perfect
home
.

stephanie
's
knowledge
of
the
market
and
properties
in
our
price
range
,
made
us
feel
secure
in
our
decision
to
buy
when
we
did
.

we
would
highly
recommend
stephanie
to
anyone
looking
for
a
home
in
the
yampa
valley
.

we
appreciated
her
patience
,
knowledge
and
kindness
!

great
barber

firstly
,
the
other
reviewer
clearly
has
never
been
to
nick
's
,
or
he
would
know
that
nick
only
charges
$
13
for
a
haircut
which
is
pretty
much
industry
standard
.

i
have
been
going
to
nick
for
5
months
now
precisely
because
he
does
pay
attention
to
detail
.

i
have
terrible
hair
and
he
really
takes
his
time
to
make
it
look
right
.

some
of
the
younger
kids
that
work
there
are
a
bit
sub
par
,
but
if
you
wait
for
nick
...
you
'll
be
good
.

ugh
!!!

got
some
nice
"
freshly
baked
"
fruit
squares
,
a
personal
favorite
of
mine
.

took
a
bite
,
it
tasted
odd
.

flipped
the
square
over
and
saw
it
riddled
with
green
mold
!!!!

ugh
!!

i
called
the
store
and
the
clerk
giggled
,
and
agreed
that
it
was
gross
,
but
said
it
was
not
her
problem
.

she
also
refused
to
get
a
manager
.

i
left
my
number
,
or
tried
to
anyway
.

same
clerk
had
considerable
difficulty
taking
down
a
number
.

i
'll
never
go
back
there
again

for
cheap
chinese
food
,
this
is
the
place
to
go
.

i
used
to
eat
at
places
like
new
china
or
green
buffet
in
troy
,
mo
-
nothing
terrible
but
not
that
great
.

now
,
i
wo
n't
eat
fast
food
chinese
unless
it
's
from
this
place
.

the
best
value
i
've
found
from
a
chinese
restaurant
.

i
do
n't
live
in
lake
st.
louis
anymore
,
but
deliveries
were
always
correct
and
the
service
courteous
.

now
i
have
to
be
in
the
area
to
get
some
lovin'
:
sad
face
:

amazing
experience
!

my
experience
was
amazing
at
providence
aesthetics
and
medical
spa
.

jana
kueck
was
nothing
but
professional
.

she
makes
you
feel
like
you
are
the
most
important
person
in
the
world
.

jana
made
me
feel
very
comfortable
.

provided
me
with
warm
blanket
and
has
soft
music
playing
.

walking
in
the
door
you
are
made
to
feel
happy
and
relaxed
.

equipment
is
state
of
the
art
.

i
would
reccomend
anyone
to
go
see
jana
kueck
and
robin
talley
to
see
all
the
many
procedures
they
have
to
offer
.

dave
is
a
patient
and
methodical
teacher
,
who
has
a
great
ear
and
sensitivity
for
his
students
'
passion
and
the
direction
they
want
their
lessons
to
take
.

also
,
he
loves
teaching
so
much
,
his
price
is
unbeatable
,
but
that
does
not
change
his
level
of
skill
.

dave
has
much
to
offer
.

in
just
2
-
3
focused
lessons
,
i
'm
already
now
capable
of
picking
up
new
songs
off
youtube
guitar
how
to
videos
and
am
even
writing
my
own
orginals
with
confidence
!

we
love
our
new
roof
!

we
would
like
to
thank
you
for
the
roofing
job
you
did
on
our
home
.

everything
was
done
on
a
timely
manner
and
things
were
cleaned
and
picked
up
every
day
when
the
crew
was
done
.

we
also
liked
the
way
that
ray
checked
on
the
job
every
day
.

and
when
the
job
was
done
every
thing
was
cleaned
up
and
hauled
off
that
same
day
.

we
would
not
hesitate
to
use
spears
roofing
again
.

we
have
already
recommended
you
to
some
of
our
friends
!

omfg

i
fucking
hate
this
place
every
time
i
go
this
hot
chick
shows
up
and
i
mean
really
hot
but
she
is
like
reaaaally
dumb
and
then
their
is
this
other
chick
that
is
realy
ugly
but
she
is
like
super
smart
she
could
be
a
scientist
,
but
then
their
is
this
stoner
who
always
comes
here
high
and
he
always
brings
his
fucking
dog
who
is
so
high
from
the
second
hand
smoke
i
think
he
is
trying
to
talk
.

anyway
we
drive
around
in
my
van
and
solve
mysterys
and
shit

amazingly
yummy
!

i
just
got
back
from
france
yesterday
and
just
missed
the
food
already
!

my
sister
in
law
told
me
about
this
amazing
new
crepe
place
in
town
,
i
was
so
excited
i
just
wanted
to
go
and
test
it
out
for
my
self
!

their
customer
service
was
perfect
!

their
food
was
better
then
anything
i
had
ever
tasted
.

even
in
france
!

i
would
highly
recommend
this
place
to
anyone
looking
for
a
great
atmosphere
,
amazing
food
,
and
great
customer
service
!

thank
you
roll
up
crepes
!

this
is
one
of
the
worst
places
i
have
stayed
,
we
cut
out
stay
short
and
went
to
the
mulberry
.

even
though
they
still
charge
you
the
days
you
booked
but
wo
n't
use
,
it
is
worth
the
get
the
hell
out
of
this
crap
hole
.

the
whole
experience
shows
a
hotel
managed
by
what
must
be
a
2
star
hotel
manager
.

bad
service
starting
from
the
front
desk
.

the
best
person
is
the
valet
.

short
of
that
,
avoid
this
place
,
as
a
silver
marriott
member
,
this
is
a
disgrace
.

best
place
in
ames

i
lived
here
for
two
years
when
the
prices
were
a
little
lower
:)
the
places
are
very
nice
and
clean
,
and
in
great
condition
!

i
really
enjoyed
the
staff
at
wessex
,
also
the
manager
sherri
was
always
very
nice
and
helpful
.

the
fitness
center
was
great
!

the
only
problem
that
i
had
in
2
years
of
living
there
was
that
the
walls
are
pretty
thin
,
sometimes
i
could
here
my
neighbors
conversations
.

i
would
recommend
these
apartments
to
anybody
!

i
absolutely
loved
living
there
.

the
best
service
ever
!!

i
have
never
had
better
service
.

my
car
broke
down
and
roadside
towed
my
vehicle
to
sussman
kia
.

they
squeezed
me
in
and
had
me
back
up
and
running
in
no
time
.

everyone
was
pleasant
and
very
helpful
.

the
service
department
even
gave
me
a
ride
home
and
picked
me
up
when
my
car
was
finished
.

the
advisor
kept
me
up
to
date
and
informed
on
the
progress
of
my
vehicle
.

i
give
this
dealer
an
a
+
!

i
will
definitely
be
bringing
my
car
back
for
service
.

heaven
on
earthhhhhhh
!!!!

must
try
!!!

a
+++

this
place
is
the
best
.

i
hated
sushi
before
but
now
i
ca
nt

nice
service
,
and
excellent
food

everything
in
here
seems
to
amaze
me

their
grill
dishes

this
world

!!!!

least

days
a
week
.

excellent
sushi

rolls
for
a
fair

friendly
,
fine
food

the
one
-
star
review
from
2005
is
out
of
date
.

there
was
a
change
of
ownership
a
couple
of
years
ago
and
service
is
both
quick
and
extremely
friendly
.

the
food
continues
to
be
very
good
--
deli
sandwiches
,
homemade
soups
,
fresh
salads
.

the
atmosphere
may
not
be
for
everyone
.

it
is
a
bustling
place
where
separate
parties
are
seated
at
the
same
table
(
as
in
many
european
cafes
)
,
but
if
you
are
ok
with
that
,
the
food
is
very
good
.

love
the
soups
.

the
new
italian
kid
on
the
block

another
italian
restaurant
in
collingswood
?

do
we
need
another
one
?

only
if
it
is
of
the
quality
of
that
's
amore
.

the
menu
has
the
usual
but
then
they
step
it
up
another
notch
.

the
arancini
di
riso
(
risotto
fritters
)
are
not
to
be
missed
.

chicken
saltimboca
was
excellent
and
then
there
's
the
chocolate
mousse
that
comes
straight
from
heaven
.

pay
extra
attention
to
the
appetizers
-
the
next
time
i
go
there
i
'm
planning
on
ordered
a
few
instead
of
an
entree
.

auto
towing
is
one
of
the
best
towing
services
i
have
used
.

the
first
time
i
used
them
they
arrived
on
time
and
towed
car
for
me
to
the
destination
i
needed
.

the
auto
mechanics
that
work
for
auto
towing
are
very
friendly
and
informative
and
answered
any
question
i
had
.

they
have
towed
car
for
me
a
few
times
and
i
am
always
very
satisfied
with
this
services
.

if
you
are
looking
for
towing
services
that
can
offer
you
a
good
towed
car
service
,
then
auto
towing
is
the
company
for
you
.

a
very
satisfied
new
customer
!

as
a
very
satisfied
new
customer
,
i
wholeheartedly
recommend
united
air
duct
cleaning
.

they
are
professional
,
knowledgeable
,
and
take
meticulous
care
and
pride
in
accomplishing
their
work
.

not
only
were
my
wife
and
i
very
pleased
,
but
i
also
had
the
air
duct
quality
tested
professionally
by
the
home
inspector
that
i
regularly
use
,
before
and
after
united
air
duct
performed
their
work
.

based
on
the
test
results
,
the
home
inspector
stated
that
the
quality
of
their
job
was
"
excellent
"
.

the
best
breakfast
in
solana
beach
!

we
love
t
's
cafe
!

without
a
doubt
the
best
place
to
grab
a
tall
bloody
mary
and
some
eggs
benedict
.

t
's
has
been
a
north
county
landmark
for
thirty
years
and
with
good
reason
.

family
owned
and
operated
makes
sure
the
atmosphere
is
relaxed
and
the
food
home
-
cooked
with
style
.

i
highly
recommend
picking
up
a
jug
of
their
homemade
bloody
mary
mix
-
definitely
the
best
.

if
you
've
been
to
north
county
,
chances
are
it
's
in
your
favorites
list
already
.

prominent
builders
nj

prominent
builders
in
new
jersey
are
one
the
best
building
contractors
,
i
was
referred
to
them
by
my
friend
,
i
am
so
glad
i
used
them
for
my
home
renovation
,
and
addition
.

they
were
very
professional
,
respectful
,
completed
the
job
on
time
,
and
well
below
my
budget
.

mike
one
of
owners
was
awesome
,
he
explained
the
detailed
plan
,
and
executed
on
time
,
i
am
always
going
use
them
and
refer
them
to
many
friends
i
can
because
of
the
great
job
they
did
me
.

great
dude
cut
!

great
service
,
cool
vibe
,
impeccable
style
.

i
'm
a
guy
with
tricky
hair
so
getting
that
right
is
job
1
.

after
going
through
5
other
places
i
finally
found
janice
at
alta
moda
.

not
only
was
it
a
good
cut
but
my
wife
and
friends
comment
on
my
hair
every
time
i
leave
...
saying
it
's
the
best
look
i
've
ever
had
.

either
i
suck
at
my
own
style
or
janice
is
a
genius
.

looks
like
there
's
a
lot
of
talent
in
this
place
.

worth
every
penny
.

my
favorite
place
at
wildwood

i
have
been
going
to
the
wildwood
,
nj
for
over
30
years
for
summer
vacations
and
always
call
the
madrid
first
.

i
rated
it
5
stars
.

i
am
not
saying
it
is
a
5
star
hotel
.

i
am
saying
when
comparing
all
other
hotels
in
wildwood
,
this
hotel
has
everything
that
we
are
looking
for
.

it
is
the
hospitality
from
tom
and
staff
,
that
makes
it
feel
like
a
5
star
hotel
in
the
middle
of
the
beach
.

we
prefer
the
layout
of
rooms
and
it
is
always
clean
.

when
in
scordia
,
sicily

if
ever
in
sicily
please
take
the
time
to
visit
anna
maria
jose
mudo
and
her
familia
.

they
are
and
always
will
be
the
nicest
people
in
sicily
that
you
will
meet
.

you
will
also
have
the
pleasure
of
learning
the
italiano
language
.

you
will
also
have
the
experience
of
learning
the
bella
sicilian
culture
,
that
i
have
fallen
in
luv
with
.

i
will
4
-
ever
be
eternally
grateful
for
their
hospitality
and
luv
that
my
sicilian
family
showed
me
when
i
was
there
for
3
years
.

luv
always
..

i
've
never
felt
the
need
to
write
a
review
or
make
a
complaint
before
,
but
after
the
way
i
was
spoken
to
by
a
member
of
staff
at
the
kennels
(
whose
name
i
believe
to
be
mrs
closs
)
i
would
now
not
recommend
this
business
to
anybody
.

if
the
animals
are
treated
in
the
same
way
the
customers
are
treated
then
this
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
!

nobody
should
be
spoken
to
like
that
regardless
of
how
bad
their
day
may
have
been
or
what
may
be
going
on
in
their
private
lives
!

best
car
dealer
in
tx

i
purchased
a
nissan
from
this
dealship
.

the
sales
men
were
very
knowledgeable
about
every
aspect
of
every
car
we
looked
at
.

they
were
very
patient
and
helpful
from
showing
the
cars
to
doing
the
paperwork
.

the
paperwork
was
a
very
easy
and
smooth
.

they
tried
to
run
my
credit
score
as
less
as
possible
so
it
wo
n't
hurt
my
score
.

overall
,
i
was
very
happy
with
the
customer
service
and
my
purchase
.

if
you
're
looking
to
buy
a
car
,
definitely
give
them
a
call
.

they
have
a
huge
inventory
.

i
have
been
a
patient
a
nw
hospital
and
it
was
great
.

i
have
also
had
an
80
yr
old
that
i
take
of
sent
to
the
er
and
long
stays
in
the
hospital
.

yes
,
we
had
to
wait
,
but
er
is
a
triage
system
that
takes
the
most
life
threatening
cases
first
.

any
er
would
be
the
same
.

as
far
as
being
treated
like
a
drug
seeker
,
that
has
not
been
my
experience
.

as
a
nurse
i
know
about
drug
seekers
.

this
is
a
great
hospital
and
even
better
since
it
became
part
of
the
uw
system
.

wonderful
experience

i
had
immense
pain
on
a
sunday
morning
,
with
friends
and
family
telling
me
that
i
would
never
find
a
dentist
on
a
sunday
.

dr.
taylor
was
not
only
available
on
a
sunday
,
but
also
was
able
to
immediately
take
care
of
me
.

he
was
incredibly
informative
about
the
options
i
had
,
giving
me
opinions
on
different
treatments
to
choose
from
.

coming
from
a
person
who
hates
the
dentist
in
general
,
dr.
taylor
was
the
best
!

he
really
made
the
visit
a
pain
free
one
with
excellent
service
!

i
would
recommend
him
to
everyone
!

horrible

this
school
is
the
worst
one
i
've
ever
been
to
.

i
attended
it
for
2
years
,
and
that
was
enough
.

there
's
holes
everywhere
in
the
ceiling
,
sewage
constantly
leaks
through
the
ceiling
,
and
the
whole
condition
of
the
school
is
horrible
.

the
staff
and
the
principal
are
rediculous
,
they
do
n't
listen
to
any
input
,
and
they
make
up
rediculous
rules
(
they
banned
backpacks
,
because
a
teacher
tripped
over
a
student
's
)
.

the
education
is
horrible
at
best
,
do
society
a
favor
,
and
do
not
send
your
student
here
.

excellent
customer
service
and
quality
work
.

they
went
the
extra
mile
to
repair
my
cowboy
boots
--
they
had
to
have
a
special
kind
of
paper
that
looked
like
wood
grain
to
fix
the
heels
.

that
was
4
years
ago
.

i
have
n't
been
able
to
find
a
shoe
repair
place
in
seattle
since
that
has
been
able
to
do
it
.

(
i
've
been
through
at
least
5
places
already
.
)

if
i
had
time
to
drive
to
tacoma
before
they
closed
during
the
work
week
,
i
would
just
so
i
could
get
those
boots
fixed
properly
again
.

so
handy
for
local
la
jolla
stuff
-
especially
for
finding
residential
numbers

since
moving
back
from
college
and
trying
to
settle
roots
in
the
village
,
i
have
referred
to
the
la
jolla
blue
book
for
a
ton
of
local
numbers
.

the
white
pages
allowed
me
to
get
in
touch
with
parents
of
my
high
school
friends
so
that
i
could
track
people
down
one
by
one
and
the
restaurant
section
is
basically
my
cookbook
.

it
's
really
cool
that
so
many
local
businesses
are
found
so
quickly
in
one
place
and
i
want
to
spread
the
word
.

thx
:-)

the
staff
do
occasionally
get
game
info
correct
,
but
if
you
r
looking
fot
a
good
game
and
are
n't
a
nerd
,
do
nt
ask
them
.

the
last
time
i
did
that
i
was
suggested
to
buy
oblivion
when
i
told
them
i
was
looking
for
a
fps
.

i
knew
what
it
was
and
told
the
guy
that
it
was
n't
a
fps
.

he
tried
to
tell
me
it
was
when
i
told
asked
him
if
he
knew
what
fps
stood
for
and
he
had
no
clue
.

overall
they
are
n't
very
knowledge
about
the
type
of
games
are
on
the
market
.

first
and
last
time
we
'll
eat
there

my
friend
and
i
went
there
for
lunch
today
.

neither
one
of
us
had
ever
been
-
so
we
thought
we
'd
try
it
.

big
mistake
-
the
food
was
tasteless
and
cold
.

we
both
kept
trying
to
find
something
we
liked
.

the
only
thing
i
found
edible
were
the
potato
wedges
,
i
finally
gave
up
,
he
kept
trying
-
he
found
the
fried
wantons
to
be
ok
-
his
mongolian
bowl
was
awful
.

would
not
recommend
this
place
to
anyone
-
in
fact
-
save
your
money
and
go
somewhere
else
.

liquidweb.com
rocks
!!!

i
am
not
a
client
of
liquidweb.com
,
but
one
of
my
friend
called
steven
is
the
client
having
several
websites
.

i
work
with
him
and
since
past
6
years
he
is
hosting
his
websites
to
liquidweb
.

as
i
have
gone
through
many
reviews
sites
to
see
if
any
provider
is
providing
better
services
or
not
,
and
i
have
realized
that
there
were
many
good
reviews
about
liquidweb
also
steven
never
faced
any
server
issues
in
his
whole
hosting
.

the
kind
of
support
they
provide
is
simply
great
!!!

i
would
like
to
host
my
upcoming
website
to
liquidweb.com

simple
but
perfect

if
you
want
flashy
fancy
food
stacked
high
with
lots
of
fussy
garnishes
,
this
is
not
the
place
for
you
.

if
you
want
perfectly
executed
simple
dishes
that
feature
a
few
exquisite
ingredients

hands
-
down
the
best
pasta
and
gnocchi
i
've
ever
eaten
(
and
i
've
eaten
a
lot
)
.

the
antipasti
were
amazing
,
the
wines
were
mind
-
blowing
,
the
service
could
n't
have
been
better
.

i
've
dined
at
lots
of
high
-
end
restaurants
and
i
've
never
before
felt
my
money
was
so
well
spent
.

great
prices
,
great
service
!

i
've
been
to
this
shop
twice
(
once
for
an
inspection
and
again
for
an
oil
change
)
and
they
truly
live
up
to
their
name
:
discount
!

they
have
all
kind
of
coupons
available
for
car
washes
,
oil
changes
,
state
inspection
,
etc
.

the
thing
is
,
you
still
get
high
quality
service
at
nicely
discounted
rates
!

there
is
even
free
coffee
and
bottles
of
water
if
you
'd
like
.

the
owner
is
a
pleasant
guy
and
i
would
trust
my
car
with
him
or
any
of
his
workers
.

top
notch
,
all
the
way
!

david
is
amazing

david
is
the
most
helpful
and
creative
photographer
that
i
have
used
.

he
is
willing
to
do
whatever
you
need
from
him
without
hesitation
.

he
was
patient
and
adapted
when
everything
did
n't
go
according
to
schedule
on
my
wedding
day
.

both
the
engagement
and
wedding
pictures
that
he
took
for
us
we
absolutely
amazing
.

he
got
the
pictures
back
to
me
quickly
.

i
would
highly
recommend
david
to
anyone
.

he
will
exceed
your
expectations
!

he
does
n't
just
take
pictures
he
makes
art
out
of
them
and
you
wo
n't
even
notice
that
there
's
a
camera
there
.

not
so
great

my
husband
just
got
a
bike
there
as
a
gift
he
's
only
had
it
a
month
.

it
's
a
nice
bike
and
it
cost
a
lot
of
money
.

but
just
this
week
a
peddle
broke
.

he
took
it
back
and
they
would
not
honor
a
warranty
and
said
it
was
his
fault
because
of
his
shoes
??

so
they
were
going
to
charge
him
for
new
peddles
and
proceeded
to
put
them
on
without
even
telling
him
the
price
.

which
was
very
expensive
.

he
asked
for
a
different
pair
instead
and
they
only
gave
him
five
dollars
off
??

trek
is
not
so
great

only
concerned
with
money

i
have
been
getting
my
treatments
for
a
few
months
now
and
have
seen
some
results
but
not
up
to
the
standards
that
i
was
told
i
should
expect
.

the
people
there
attempt
to
come
across
and
professional
and
nice
,
but
i
was
disappointed
with
their
customer
service
.

never
miss
an
appointment
because
they
will
charge
you
the
price
of
a
treatment
,
even
if
you
had
an
emergency
.

it
's
pretty
ridiculous
!

they
want
to
squeeze
as
much
as
they
can
from
you
even
if
you
just
got
in
a
car
accident
!!!!

they
do
n't
care
one
bit
about
you
!!!!!

terrible
service
!!!

made
an
appointment
to
have
them
come
to
the
house
to
discuss
curtain
options
and
give
an
estimate
.

they
sent
over
someone
who
said
he
knows
nothing
about
curtains
and
could
not
show
me
fabric
options
or
give
an
estimate
.

when
i
called
the
manager
to
complain
,
she
said
she
knew
the
guy
did
n't
know
about
curtains
and
that
the
usual
lady
called
in
sick
hours
earlier
!

instead
of
rescheduling
they
chose
to
waste
my
time
instead
.

so
what
was
the
point
of
the
appointment
!?!

to
just
come
over
and
hang
out
?!?

i
will
never
do
business
with
this
company
!

ever
!!!

internet
department
is
rude
and
insulting

i
was
looking
to
bring
a
customer
to
their
lot
to
buy
a
car
but
the
internet
salesperson
last
name
is
balazick
sent
me
this
email
"
and
if
it
was
worth
my
time
i
would
of
bothered
aswering
your
questions
.

i
make
money
not
deal
with
brokers
"
wow
,
can
you
believe
in
today
s
tough
times
this
dealership
would
be
looking
for
any
way
to
move
vehicles
.

as
a
previous
internet
manager
i
would
deal
with
anyone
looking
to
buy
a
car
for
a
profit
and
not
care
if
they
came
in
with
a
broker
.

stay
away
from
this
dealership
!!!

this
place
is
a
rip
-
off

i
brought
a
car
in
to
have
the
"
check
engine
"
light
diagnosed
back
in
march
of
2010
.

they
said
it
was
"
plugs
and
wires
"
and
quoted
me
$
330
to
do
the
work
,
including
parts
.

i
asked
why
so
high
and
they
said
it
was
due
to
the
labor
of
moving
things
out
of
the
way
.

those
things
ended
up
being
a
windsheild
washer
fluid
tank
(
1
screw
)
and
the
air
filter
canister
(
4
spring
clips
)
.

i
did
the
work
myself
for
$
50
.

there
's
no
excuse
for
that
kind
of
estimate
.

my
girlfriend
and
i
took
a
chance
on
this
place
because
we
did
n't
want
to
wait
in
line
at
outback
.

what
an
amazing
find
-
this
restaurant
is
a
gem
.

1
it
s
immaculately
clean
.

2
the
decor
is
tasteful
and
artistic
,
from
the
comfortable
chairs
to
the
elegant
light
fixtures
....
and
(
most
importantly
)
3
the
food
is
fantastic
.

this
is
authentic
cuban
cuisine
;
fresh
ingredients
expertly
prepared
and
seasoned
perfectly
.

the
portions
were
generous
and
we
got
out
for
less
than
the
cost
of
one
entree
at
some
chain
restaurant
.

try
this
place
-
you
'll
love
it
.

thank
you
for
helping
me
get
more
healthy
!

i
came
in
and
saw
dr.
ruona
about
a
month
ago
for
quitting
smoking
.

i
have
to
tell
you
that
i
have
n't
had
one
and
do
n't
want
one
.

it
is
the
easiest
thing
that
i
have
ever
done
and
i
tell
all
my
friends
that
they
should
do
it
too
.

i
sent
a
customer
of
mine
to
you
.

dr.
ruona
,
if
you
read
this
,
thank
you
for
helping
me
get
more
healthy
.

i
feel
lighter
and
feel
that
i
have
more
possibilities
open
to
me
now
than
i
did
before
.

i
ca
n't
thank
you
enough
.

fantastic
for
kids

if
you
have
children
or
are
just
a
real
animal
lover
yourself
you
'll
love
this
zoo
.

it
's
only
$
10
and
in
essence
just
one
big
petting
zoo
.

they
sell
feed
and
milk
bottles
at
the
front
and
i
recommend
you
buy
lots
.

we
took
our
7
month
old
and
she
laughed
and
giggled
when
(
very
harshly
i
might
add
)
grabbing
and
'
kissed
'
the
goats
and
lambs
.

the
animals
were
all
very
sweet
and
patient
with
her
.

among
the
animals
that
were
available
to
touch
were
pony's
,
camels
and
even
an
ostrich
!!!

wonderful
,
inexpensive
and
lots
of
fun
!

wow
!!!

i
ca
n't
say
enough
good
things
about
karla
and
the
wonderful
things
she
has
done
for
me
and
my
dog
gracee
.

gracee
is
more
excited
to
see
her
than
she
is
to
see
me
!!!!

she
has
always
been
there
for
gracee
even
for
last
minute
calls
!

she
has
taken
care
of
my
sweet
girl
for
almost
4
years
now
and
i
would
not
let
gracee
go
with
anyone
besides
her
!!!

she
is
caring
,
punctual
,
and
very
enthusiastic
about
her
job
!

you
should
give
her
a
try
-
it
's
worth
every
penny
to
know
that
you
pet
is
in
great
hands
with
wunderbar
pet
sitting
!!!!

worst
service
i
've
ever
experienced

i
wish
there
was
something
good
to
say
about
the
business
,
but
unfortunately
,
there
is
n't
.

1
)
service
and
manners
were
nonexistent
.

2
)
the
employees
constantly
talk
down
to
customers
and
are
very
argumentative
for
the
sake
of
being
argumentative
.

(
to
both
myself
and
customers
)
3
)
i
have
never
experienced
so
much
rudeness
coming
from
a
business
.

4
)
the
business
is
very
unorganized
.

the
invoice
is
not
detailed
,
so
it
is
difficult
to
see
what
you
are
paying
for
.

i
'd
recommend
to
save
your
time
and
energy
and
find
another
greek
store
.

exile
is
the
best
!!!

exile
is
the
longest
lasting
and
most
authentic
punk
store
in
richmond
!

i
have
been
shopping
there
for
over
six
years
now
.

the
staff
is
incredibly
friendly
and
helpful
and
the
owner
,
mimmy
,
is
an
absolute
angel
.

the
mark
up
is
minimal
considering
that
the
clothing
is
hard
to
find
and
often
shipped
for
europe
.

in
addition
,
the
clothing
is
of
much
better
quality
than
the
clothing
from
hot
topic
,
which
is
made
as
cheaply
as
possible
by
people
living
in
horrible
conditions
in
asia
.

exile
is
environmentally
conscious
and
involved
heavily
in
our
community
.

over-rated

buddakan
inevitably
attracts
the
majority
of
its
guests
simply
because
of
its
association
with
steven
starr
,
but
that
does
n't
impress
me
.

the
atmosphere
alone
deserves
4
stars
but
,
the
food
was
not
up
to
par
with
the
price
tag
and
the
reputation
the
restaurant
carries
.

the
server
we
had
was
knowledgeable
but
he
was
not
as
proper
as
he
should
have
been
,
acting
like
he
was
talking
to
his
friends
rather
than
his
customers
.

the
angry
lobster
was
completely
over-priced
!

$
80
for
a
dish
that
has
about
one
small
lobster
tail
and
is
full
of
filler
vegetables
!

i
would
n't
go
there
again
.

alto
delivers
on
all
levels
.

from
the
moment
you
enter
the
restaurant
,
you
know
you
are
some
place
special
.

the
service
is
impeccable
,
and
the
food
is
even
better
.

i
highly
recommend
the
four
-
course
tasting
menu
,
which
gives
you
plenty
of
range
and
food
to
satisfy
your
appetite
.

also
,
if
you
are
into
wine
,
alto
has
the
depth
of
both
region
,
varietal
,
and
vintage
to
satisfy
nearly
any
sommelier
(
or
after
9
pm
,
bring
your
own
bottle
for
free
...
no
corking
fee
!
)
.

while
it
's
not
cheap
,
alto
will
give
you
an
experience
you
'll
never
forget
.

the
landlord
is
not
nice
nor
helpful

i
have
lived
in
buckingham
condominiums
townhouse
for
2
years
.

i
love
the
location
and
the
apartment
!!

i
'm
a
single
female
and
i
feel
safe
coming
home
at
night
.

the
maintenance
people
are
awesome
!!!!

and
the
exterminator
is
very
nice
,
also
.

yes
,
you
still
have
a
few
bugs
,
but
that
's
going
to
be
anywhere
you
go
!

the
only
problem
that
i
have
experienced
is
the
landlord
.

she
is
a
pure
b****
!!!

i
know
that
's
ugly
...
but
she
wo
n't
help
you
out
for
anything
...
sad
story
.

other
than
that
,
i
would
recommend
living
here
.
:)

the
staff
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
.

the
front
staff
has
seen
quite
a
bit
of
turnover
and
changed
from
professional
to
rude
.

a
simple
follow
-
up
phone
call
with
a
woman
quickly
turned
into
a
nightmare
.

she
may
be
the
reason
for
all
the
change
.

i
sincerely
wonder
if
the
doctor
has
a
clue
about
what
is
going
on
within
his
practice
.

if
he
does
know
and
approves
of
this
behavior
then
it
is
a
poor
reflection
on
him
.

sometimes
it
is
not
worth
it
to
go
through
that
kind
of
staff
and
their
personal
attitude
to
get
to
a
doctor
.

he
was
an
okay
doctor
but
not
worth
her
.

wonderful
wild
wildernest
inn

i
would
give
the
wildernest
inn
ten
stars
of
five
!

atop
spring
mountain
,
from
the
decks
of
the
west
porch
,
"
one
can
see
forever
"
a
scene
of
unparalleled
beauty
and
grandeur
.

i
saw
deer
frequently
,
in
fact
a
small
herd
were
grazing
near
the
lodge
.

there
were
occasional
bears
on
the
deck
in
the
morning
.

and
most
correctly
,
us
visitors
did
not
mingle
with
the
native
wildlife
.

it
would
have
been
more
than
one
could
bear
!

kathy
and
stewart
,
the
proprietors
were
the
epitome
of
perfection
.

delightful
,
hospitable
,
superb
,
cozy
and
comfortable
.

i
hope
to
be
back
!

junkie
lube
?!

really
weird
place
,
i
was
driving
home
from
work
thought
i
'd
stop
in
for
an
oil
change
and
well
,
there
are
a
few
guys
in
jiffy
lube
uniforms
sitting
at
the
table
drinking
beers
and
shooting
the
breeze
.

the
neon
lighting
sign
still
said
"
on
"
yet
some
guy
who
seemed
to
be
the
oldest
of
the
bunch
,
more
like
the
drunkest
of
the
bunch
told
me
they
'd
be
open
tomorrow
.

i
asked
if
a
manager
was
on
duty
he
told
me
he
was
.

wow
!

grey
shirt
"
mark
"
of
course
with
this
type
behavior
he
could
have
been
wearing
someon
else
s
clothing
.....

a
friend
and
i
recently
took
our
16
and
18
month
olds
here
.

while
there
was
n't
too
much
available
for
their
age
(
ball
pit
,
bouncy
area
and
a
little
padded
pyramid
to
climb
on
)
,
we
went
right
when
they
opened
at
10
am
on
a
winter
weekday
and
ended
up
being
the
only
ones
there
,
so
we
were
given
a
little
more
liberty
than
we
would
have
if
others
had
been
there
.

it
's
not
the
classiest
place
,
but
it
was
cleaner
than
i
expected
and
the
staff
was
very
friendly
.

for
$
4
it
was
a
nice
break
from
the
monotony
of
winter
indoors
with
a
toddler
.

restored
my
faith
in
mechaincs
.

i
spent
3
months
going
from
shop
to
shop
trying
to
get
my
ferrari
to
run
and
drive
the
way
it
should
.

i
was
about
to
give
up
when
i
met
jason
and
neal
.

they
took
on
the
challenge
of
making
my
ferrari
all
i
dreamed
of
and
more
.

the
crew
at
the
creative
workshop
went
over
and
above
the
call
of
duty
and
gave
me
back
a
car
i
can
drive
anywhere
and
finally
enjoy
owning
.

i
can
not
say
enough
about
this
place
.

they
have
restored
my
faith
in
mechanics
.

do
yourself
a
favor
,
call
these
guys
first
and
enjoy
driving
your
car
again
..

a
great
vacation
!

we
wanted
to
see
the
sun
-
and
we
also
got
much
more
!

excellent
chefs
are
in
the
kitchen
preparing
memorable
breakfasts
.

after
a
train
ride
over
the
mountains
,
we
enjoyed
hiking
in
the
flower
-
filled
wenatchee
hills
(
in
may
)
and
a
very
interesting
bike
ride
in
a
loop
around
the
columbia
river
...
and
then
wine
if
we
wanted
it
on
the
patio
in
the
evening
....

this
is
a
busy
group
of
hosts
they
are
also
running
a
restaurant
,
which
also
must
be
wonderful
-
so
just
ask
for
what
you
need
,
and
i
'm
sure
they
will
do
their
best
to
be
hospitable
.

omg

omg
..
make
sure
to
book
a
reservation
,
as
this
magical
place
is
packed
(
in
a
nice
way
)
i
love
that
the
owner
walks
around
and
cares
how
his
customers
feel
about
their
food
.

the
waiters
are
like
no
other
...

my
waiter
was
so
excellent
i
gave
him
a
75
%
tip
,
and
it
was
worht
every
penny
..

the
food
was
finger
licking
the
bowel
fantastic
..

i
just
discovered
her
has
a
place
right
near
my
work
(
color
me
phat
)
if
you
are
looking
for
a
romatic
place
with
the
best
food
and
service
in
the
valley
giovanni
ristorante
should
be
your
number
1
+
2
choice
.

holly
is
truely
the
best
hairstylist
!

i
have
lived
in
the
utc
la
jolla
area
for
many
years
,
and
i
never
new
this
salon
was
here
until
a
friend
reffered
me
to
see
holly
here
.

i
was
very
pleased
with
my
experience
here
.

all
of
the
people
were
friendly
and
welcoming
.

i
got
highlights
,
haircut
,
and
a
blowdry
.

she
did
a
great
job
!

holly
is
very
experienced
and
talented
,
and
i
could
tell
she
new
what
she
was
doing
right
off
the
bat
.

my
hair
looks
amazing
,
and
i
get
compliments
all
the
time
.

i
deffenitly
reccomend
this
salon
and
holly
to
anyone
.

you
will
not
be
disappointed
!!!!!!

outdated
but
not
bad

so
i
really
felt
like
this
place
was
extremely
outdated
especially
since
the
pictures
make
it
look
nice
and
modern
.

it
had
listed
that
there
was
a
hot
breakfast
but
all
this
meant
is
that
they
added
a
waffle
maker
to
the
common
continental
affair
at
most
cheap
hotels
.

the
family
suite
was
basically
two
rooms
with
a
small
opening
between
them
which
worked
great
for
us
because
we
were
two
families
traveling
together
.

if
you
are
in
town
and
need
that
kind
of
space
i
say
stay
here
but
if
you
are
looking
for
a
little
more
upscale
affair
do
n't
let
the
pictures
fool
you
and
book
somewhere
else
.

great
,
and
probably
the
only
west
indian
spot
worth
hitting
up
in
nashville
.

i
was
born
and
raised
in
toronto
,
which
has
a
huge
west
indian
(
trinidadian
,
jamaican
,
etc
)
population
.

so
huge
in
fact
,
that
toronto
slang
is
influenced
by
and
has
jamaican
references
,
and
jamaican
beef
patties
are
staples
in
my
high
school
cafeteria
.

anyway
,
i
was
practically
raised
on
this
stuff
,
and
being
a
connoisseur
of
west
indian
cuisine
,
jamaica
way
is
a
bit
toned
down
to
suit
the
american
palette
.

all
you
have
to
do
to
make
it
authentic
jamaican
food
,
is
add
a
whole
lot
of
pepper
.

a
lot
.

the
finest
christmas
trees
i
've
ever
seen
.

i
felt
like
i
was
in
heaven
when
i
walked
through
the
majestic
fields
of
this
particular
farm
.

the
trees
were
in
magnificent
shape
and
the
variety
was
astounding
.

the
owners
were
entertaining
and
gracious
.

i
especially
liked
the
eco
friendly
atmosphere
and
the
owner
s
love
of
all
animals
.

this
is
one
of
the
best
farms
i
have
ever
been
too
.

i
would
call
it
the
taj
mahal
of
the
east
coast
!

it
put
hair
on
my
chest
and
thanks
to
the
owner
s
advice
i
invested
vanguard
,
got
myself
a
woman
like
jerry
,
and
became
a
republican
.

thanks

pho
-
nomenal
!!

i
have
been
eating
pho
for
almost
my
entire
life
and
i
've
always
gone
to
the
pho
places
in
south
philly
and
off
the
boulevard
and
even
the
other
one
in
chinatown
,
but
when
i
tried
this
pho
place
,
it
blew
the
other
pho
houses
away
!!

all
of
the
pho
places
taste
the
same
to
me
,
so
what
seperates
one
from
the
other
is
the
service
and
the
price
.

the
service
here
is
incredible
compared
to
the
other
places
.

the
only
down
fall
of
this
pho
house
is
the
difficulty
in
finding
parking
in
chinatown
.

remember
to
bring
cash
since
they
do
n't
take
debit
or
credit
.

hope
this
helps
!!

had
a
horrible
experience
with
a
manager
here
,
rachel
mcinnis
,
she
was
rude
,
inconsiderate
and
did
not
do
the
right
thing
for
an
item
that
was
marked
incorrectly
...

i
'm
not
interested
in
shopping
in
a
place
with
people
like
her
...
she
refused
to
sell
me
the
item
at
its
marked
price
even
after
admitting
they
had
made
a
mistake
.

i
normally
do
n't
write
reviews
but
seeing
that
i
considered
dillards
a
distinguished
,
upscale
place
to
shop
,
this
one
wo
n't
be
getting
my
business
,
nor
my
family
's
,
nor
my
co-workers
.

it
's
never
ok
to
let
a
customer
walk
out
unhappy
,
especially
when
they
are
right
.

highly
recommend

i
work
as
a
transformational
life
coach
.

since
this
is
an
alternative
therapy
i
always
refer
clients
to
a
lisenced
therapist
when
i
feel
that
is
appropriate
.

i
found
her
through
a
colleague
one
day
when
one
of
my
clients
was
in
the
midst
of
a
panic
attack
and
needed
professional
help
that
i
am
not
qualified
to
provide
.

little
did
i
know
that
i
would
soon
be
needing
her
help
as
well
!

she
guided
me
through
a
very
difficult
period
dealing
with
a
family
member
's
suicide
,
coupled
with
elder
abuse
.

i
found
her
to
be
extremely
solid
,
kind
,
compassionate
,
and
intuitive
as
well
.

i
would
recommend
her
highly
!

they
wo
n't
have
a
second
chance
from
me
.

first
,
let
me
state
that
although
i
live
in
nyc
,
i
am
not
from
nyc
,
i
do
n't
care
about
baseball
and
i
absolutely
love
boston
to
death
(
so
beautiful
,
so
clean
,
so
awesome
)
.

that
said
,
i
hated
this
restaurant
.

the
service
was
just
about
as
good
as
i
'd
get
in
nyc
(
that
means
it
was
poor
)
and
the
food
was
almost
mediocre
.

the
decor
left
a
lot
to
be
desired
and
the
posters
telling
me
all
the
reasons
99
was
great
just
served
as
an
ironic
contrast
against
the
reality
.

personally
i
recommend
you
take
your
money
elsewhere

when
i
arrived
at
brickell
honda
on
6/4/11
,
i
was
greeted
and
attended
to
by
the
sales
manager
,
gustavo
guerra
,
in
a
very
friendly
and
professional
manner
.

i
explained
to
him
what
i
wanted
and
that
i
previously
went
to
braman
honda
.

bramen
honda
was
a
bit
of
a
hassle
.

he
told
me
"
no
problem
,
we
will
match
the
offer
or
do
better
.
"

mr.
guerra
gave
me
a
better
deal
without
any
hassles
nor
any
type
of
problems
.

brickell
honda
has
been
the
best
buying
experience
in
the
world
.

i
urge
all
st.
thomas
the
apostle
parishioners
and
all
of
south
florida
residents
to
come
see
gus
!!!

excellent
customer
service
!!!

great
,
honest
service

i
took
my
2001
nissan
frontier
in
to
fix
a
cracked
manifold
.

the
dealer
wanted
$
1300
to
fix
that
and
another
$
1500
to
fix
some
other
things
.

eagle
transmission
determined
that
much
of
the
work
the
dealer
said
needed
to
be
done
was
unneccesary
and
what
needed
to
be
fixed
was
only
$
400
!!

i
was
so
impressed
with
the
honesty
and
integrity
of
mike
and
everyone
at
eagle
transmission
!

i
dropped
the
truck
off
in
the
morning
and
it
was
ready
that
afternoon
.

i
have
finally
found
a
mechanic
i
trust
!!

and
it
was
great
that
they
did
not
charge
a
service
fee
to
diagnose
the
problem
-
an
added
bonus
!!

dr.
shady

kelly
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
.

"
dr.
shady
"
is
a
jerk
.

after
the
way
she
spoke
to
me
on
my
last
visit
,
i
will
not
be
returning
!!

good
luck
keeping
business
with
that
stuck
up
attitude
dr.
shady
.

you
have
just
lost
mine
.

the
next
time
you
feel
like
being
condescending
to
someone
,
it
is
not
going
to
be
me
!!!!!!

dr.
shady
is
inexperienced
and
prideful
.

she
probably
does
not
even
have
10
%
of
the
knowledge
that
some
of
the
other
experienced
vets
do
in
this
area
.

i
will
be
carefully
researching
vets
before
i
take
my
dog
someplace
else
.

beautifully
written
reviews
doctor
,
but
completely
untrue
.

poor
experience

i
did
not
have
a
good
experience
w
/
dr.
ghassemlou
.

during
the
session
,
he
demanded
to
have
my
physical
address
,
which
i
've
always
kept
private
as
i
am
enrolled
in
a
witness
protection
program
.

i
believe
he
is
correct
in
that
he
needs
my
physical
address
for
legal
reasons
,
however
,
he
did
not
adequately
explain
this
during
our
session
.

i
learned
more
about
this
doing
my
own
research
afterward
.

i
think
he
could
've
done
more
to
assuage
my
concerns
by
giving
me
concrete
facts
.

saying
that
i
need
to
give
him
my
address
or
else
i
have
intimacy
issues
is
not
helpful
.

it
's
pretty
combative
actually
.

you
'll
love
it

i
have
had
my
back
fused
in
2
places
.

i
wish
that
i
had
n't
done
this
.

with
these
fusions
,
chiropractric
is
n't
as
successful
,
but
it
still
is
very
helpful
.

even
after
my
fusions
,
my
back
continued
to
hurt
,
but
now
it
does
n't
hurt
any
more
.

i
would
encourage
anyone
who
is
thinking
of
back
surgery
,
to
talk
about
different
treatment
options
first
with
dr.
de
barros
.

he
really
knows
what
he
is
talking
about
and
will
approach
the
different
options
fairly
.

you
can
see
different
treatments
that
a
surgeon
ca
n't
see
,
so
that
you
can
have
several
treatment
options
before
you
decide
what
to
do
.

unbelievably
huge
experience
for
such
a
small
salon
!!!

i
have
been
to
kim
at
cheveux
for
more
than
five
years
.

i
can
not
tell
you
how
often
i
am
complimented
on
my
hair
(
style
and
color
)
!

i
regularly
request
kim
's
business
cards
as
i
am
often
stopped
on
the
street
and
asked
"
who
does
your
hair
...
i
love
it
!!!
"

quaint
,
lovely
,
small
salon
with
big
personality
.

i
am
made
to
feel
special
when
i
am
in
the
chair
and
i
have
never
had
a
less
than
amazing
cut
or
color
experience
.

my
hair
has
never
felt
this
healthy
,
either
.

i
can
not
recommend
this
salon
enough
!!!

thanks
cheveux
!

my
favorite
in
mclean

my
family
loves
coming
to
endo
sushi
.
they
are
very
nice
,
it
is
never
crowded
,
and
the
food
is
wonderful
,
very
delicious
and
fresh
!

sometimes
it
is
hard
to
get
parking
in
the
lot
in
front
of
the
storefront
,
and
it
is
on
a
one
-
way
street
,
but
the
restaurant
itself
is
never
overcrowded
.

if
you
can
not
park
in
the
lot
,
then
you
can
park
in
the
shopping
center
's
garage
,
and
walk
up
to
endo
sushi
.

the
service
is
fast
.

be
sure
to
ring
the
little
bell
on
your
way
out
if
you
enjoyed
your
meal
!

(
it
's
by
the
door
,
on
the
hostess
stand
)

horrible
service
!

i
got
yelled
at
,
literally
yelled
at
because
i
asked
if
i
could
pick
up
my
car
5
-
10
minutes
late
.

i
explained
that
i
was
already
on
my
way
and
i
would
rush
to
get
there
as
soon
as
i
could
because
i
needed
my
car
for
work
at
5
am
,
but
the
guy
was
arguing
with
me
saying
he
was
gon
na
lock
the
doors
right
at
5:30
.

rude
,
unprofessional
,
just
jerks
.

seems
like
all
they
care
about
is
the
money
and
getting
home
on
time
,
no
care
for
the
customers
at
all
!!!

missed
a
whole
day
of
work
because
i
am
now
carless
.

i
will
neeeeeeeeeverrrr
go
to
this
place
again
.

superb
arrangements

i
used
fancy
flowers
for
my
late
husband
's
funeral
flowers
as
they
had
been
recommended
to
me
.

i
am
so
glad
that
i
called
in
to
see
ana
,
she
is
a
lovely
girl
who
showed
nothing
but
care
and
compassion
towards
me
.

the
flowers
were
all
that
i
hoped
they
would
be
,
i
have
attended
several
funerals
of
late
unfortunately
and
the
flowers
i
recieved
from
ana
outshone
them
all
.

she
is
so
talented
,
the
flowers
were
arranged
superbly
and
delicately
,
it
is
so
obvious
to
see
the
difference
between
someone
fully
trained
and
skilled
compared
to
others
.

thank
you
ana
i
hope
to
see
you
in
the
future
under
better
circumstances
.

great
first
experience
.

i
'm
22
,
and
my
hairdresser
was
great
(
and
not
"
old
"
like
one
of
the
reviews
says
)
-
she
really
listened
to
what
i
wanted
and
gave
me
tons
of
tips
on
how
to
style
my
hair
so
i
could
get
it
to
look
the
way
i
wanted
it
to
.

she
deep
conditioned
my
hair
and
took
the
time
to
style
it
properly
.

she
recommended
products
but
absolutely
did
n't
pressure
me
to
buy
.

it
's
a
cute
place
with
a
really
friendly
,
laid
-
back
atmosphere
.

i
would
highly
recommend
it
and
will
be
going
back
for
my
next
haircut
.

oh
!

and
students
get
$
5
off
,
ca
n't
argue
with
that
.

smoker
s
haven

yeah
,
this
complex
is
not
very
good
.

our
bathroom
fan
,
one
electric
outlet
and
2
leaky
sinks
have
yet
to
be
fixed
.

both
bathrooms
look
like
they
were
flooded
and
the
wood
cabinets
are
thrashed
at
the
bottom
and
they
slapped
some
pieces
of
wood
over
to
try
to
cover
it
up
.

and
non-smokers
beware
!!!

i
think
90
percent
of
the
tenants
are
smokers
!

if
you
do
not
smoke
,
do
not
move
here
.

our
unit
reeks
of
old
cigarette
smoke
and
it
started
to
become
apparent
a
few
weeks
after
we
moved
in
.

you
can
not
walk
5
feet
without
smelling
that
disgusting
cigarette
smoke
and
it
blows
right
into
the
windows
all
day
and
all
night
.

great
sanwiches
,
great
prices

i
used
to
go
here
almost
every
day
since
i
work
in
the
neighbourhood
and
loved
their
turkey
and
meatball
sandwiches
.

chicken
salad
salad
is
great
too
.

best
of
all
,
the
staff
is
quick
on
their
feet
and
even
with
long
lines
,
usually
serve
you
in
5
minutes
or
less
.

for
the
quality
,
the
prices
(
$
4
-
$
6
)
have
to
be
the
best
in
town
.

the
staff
get
to
know
regulars
and
do
their
job
very
well
.

tourists
like
the
other
reviewer
might
not
appreciate
their
efficiency
or
quality
,
but
i
certainly
do
.

this
is
n't
a
tgif
or
cafe
,
it
s
a
lunch
sandwich
place
and
a
good
one
at
that
.

rate
a
church
?

might
as
well
just
hotpot
the
curb
and
rate
the
traffic
light
.

it
's
a
bloody
church
,
for
chrisssake
!

big
,
grey
and
imposing
.

go
there
on
christian
holidays
for
a
bit
of
churchy
grandure
.

the
pastor
at
this
church
is
cool
,
i
met
him
after
some
holiday
service
.

he
had
a
robe
that
was
made
back
in
the
'60s
.

god
was
pleased
with
that
one
!

it
's
historical
for
sf
,
so
when
your
aunte
comes
for
a
visit
,
take
her
there
.

great
for
the
kiddies
-
they
love
the
labyrinth
(
do
n't
forget
to
tell
'em
it
s
really
a
'
pagen
'
thing
!
)
.

stop
by
at
least
once
or
you
'll
go
to
heck
!

ok
but
just
becuse
we
where
on
a
tight
budget
.

me
and
my
dad
where
in
nj
for
a
kc
chiefs
(
my
home
team
)
vs
the
ny
jets
and
for
game
4
of
the
world
series
.

i
'm
a
red
sox
fan
so
i
was
glad
that
the
phillies
won
.

the
knights
inn
was
small
very
small
.
i
mean
1
room
in
every
room
!
it
was
cozy
a
little
and
a
small
tv
.

i
mean
a
2
day
stay
was
a
ok
stay
even
tho
the
manager
looked
like
he
was
chineze
and
that
we
only
slept
and
went
out
from
8
to
7
to
see
new
york
.

but
sice
we
almost
just
slept
there
i
ca
nt
give
that
good
of
a
review

it
was
a
saturday
and
my
spring
was
broken
...

i
googled
garage
door
repair
in
woodinville
and
found
ndi
-
johnette
answered
the
phone
and
was
oh
-
so
pleasant
and
helpful
!

she
sort
of
appologized
for
dan
taking
the
day
off
to
go
skiing
-
but
he
could
do
the
repair
on
sunday
!

i
said
great
and
dan
arrived
on
time
at
10
am
to
make
the
repair
.

i
enjoyed
speaking
with
dan
,
and
learning
more
about
how
the
springs
are
sized
for
these
doors
.

the
repair
went
quickly
and
the
price
was
extremely
fair
.

i
would
highly
recommend
ndi
-
and
will
spread
the
word
to
my
neighbors
.

thanks
dan
and
johnette
for
your
responsiveness
and
professional
service
.

roger
m.
,
woodinville

i
would
n't
send
my
dogs
there
.

i
had
a
conversation
with
the
woman
running
this
place
in
april
2010
.

she
basically
said
if
the
children
getting
off
the
bus
are
n't
paying
to
enter
her
building
she
was
going
to
let
them
wander
around
the
streets
.

wow
,
really
?

with
all
the
child
predators
out
there
,
a
busy
road
,
cars
speeding
by
......
and
you
are
going
to
let
some
4
/
5
year
olds
wonder
around
cause
you
're
money
hungry
?

real
christian
of
you
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

whether
they
pay
me
or
not
,
if
their
parents
get
into
an
accident
,
stuck
in
traffic
,
etc.
the
last
thing
i
would
do
is
let
a
child
get
raped
because
i
was
n't
paid
.

excellent
service

i
could
easily
go
to
nordstrom
for
my
designer
jeans
and
pay
the
same
price
,
but
i
go
to
the
garment
district
for
their
service
.

previous
reviewers
said
they
were
pushy
and
i
can
understand
that
,
but
i
find
the
staff
more
helpful
than
anything
else
.

tiffany
is
fabulous
!

i
came
in
for
alterations
(
free
,
by
the
way
)
and
told
her
about
a
stain
i
had
on
my
new
leather
purse
.

she
immediately
went
to
the
back
,
brought
out
leather
cleaner
and
cleaned
my
purse
on
the
spot
.

i
did
n't
even
buy
the
bag
there
!

huge
selection
and
,
great
suggestions
from
the
staff
and
they
refer
you
to
reliable
places
if
they
do
n't
have
what
you
need
.

we
were
expecting
a
great
experience
,
when
we
recieved
a
friendly
greeting
by
the
hosts
.

the
atmosphere
was
nice
and
very
clean
.

the
menu
had
plenty
of
options
even
for
picky
eaters
.

the
service
was
ok
,
our
waitress
kept
forgetting
our
drinks
even
though
we
reminded
her
several
times
.

to
start
we
tried
the
guacamole
and
salsa
verde
,
it
was
completly
flavorless
.

we
should
have
left
then
.

we
orderd
our
meals
anyway
,
chimichangas
,
jalapeno
borritos
,
and
quesadillas
.

everything
was
bland
,
completely
void
of
any
spice
or
flavor
.

we
have
never
had
mexican
food
this
bad
,
it
was
just
simply
gross
.

hopefully
they
spice
things
up
or
they
wo
nt
be
in
business
long
.

i
recommend
la
hacienda

might
try
again

pros
:
*
jill
,
the
owner
,
is
very
nice
and
really
cares
about
her
feedback
*
pretty
nice
atmosphere
*
great
dessert
*
not
your
typical
veggie
selection
,
i
like
!

do
n't
know
where
else
you
can
find
purple
hull
peas
and
some
of
the
other
sides
.

cons
:
*
server
was
n't
very
pleasant
*
pretty
small
portion
on
the
blackened
catfish
*
overcooked
food
*
time
,
took
about
25
minutes
from
ordering
to
eating
.

half
the
tables
and
bar
were
empty
by
this
point
.

other
thoughts
:
will
try
this
place
again
.

there
must
be
a
reason
so
many
people
like
it
there
.

their
club
sandwich
looks
tasty
,
maybe
that
'll
change
my
mind
....
and
a
different
server
.

very
professional
/
very
helpful

the
people
at
fidelity
leasing
were
very
friendly
and
helpful
.

i
was
looking
for
a
car
but
did
not
really
know
what
i
wanted
and
they
were
very
helpful
and
took
the
time
to
first
figure
out
what
my
needs
were
and
showing
me
various
options
to
meet
those
needs
.

they
seemed
more
interested
in
helping
me
find
the
right
car
rather
then
just
make
a
sale
.

my
experience
with
them
was
great
-
low
stress
,
very
helpful
and
very
personal
.

after
finding
the
car
i
wanted
they
took
the
time
to
go
over
each
step
and
making
it
as
painless
as
possible
.

from
start
to
finish
they
were
top
notch
.

i
would
highly
recommend
calling
these
people
up
for
your
next
car
.

this
insurance
co.
is
a
joke
!!!

they
have
absolutely
no
communication
skills
whatsoever
.

if
you
do
n't
mind
being
robbed
,
cheated
or
lied
to
then
this
is
the
company
for
you
.

they
will
make
every
attempt
to
misinform
and
misrepresent
themselves
.

they
make
up
excuses
in
hopes
to
confuse
their
policy
holders
with
misinformation
.

as
an
example
they
took
payment
for
5
out
of
6
monthly
plan
premiums
for
a
yearly
policy
and
cancelled
the
contract
for
the
remainder
of
the
policy
for
reasons
they
stated
was
not
receiving
information
on
other
licensed
drivers
in
the
household
?

i
personally
provided
the
request
on
four
separate
occasions
and
they
claim
there
is
a
glitch
in
their
systems
?

ifa
is
an
acronym
for
i
m
a
f%#king
assh@%$e
!!!

fantastic
service
!

i
have
been
here
a
few
times
for
oil
changes
and
just
got
my
tires
,
alignment
and
state
inspection
done
yesterday
.

i
shopped
it
around
and
they
were
extremely
competitive
in
pricing
and
also
added
nitrogen
to
my
tires
which
should
extend
the
life
and
get
me
better
gas
mileage
.

it
also
came
with
free
balance
and
rotation
for
the
life
of
the
tires
!

what
made
it
perfect
was
that
they
offered
transportation
so
that
i
would
not
have
to
wait
there
or
take
time
off
of
work
to
go
back
and
forth
or
try
to
find
a
ride
.

great
service
,
great
pricing
and
super
convenient
!

i
also
did
not
feel
like
they
tried
to
sell
me
a
bunch
of
services
that
i
did
not
need
.

love
my
home
at
creekside

i
moved
to
creekside
apartments
in
august
2008
with
a
6
-
month
lease
and
have
just
extended
it
for
another
13
months
!

the
management
from
julie
and
janice
to
the
work
staff
,
esp.
edwin
,
are
just
wonderful
.

they
have
been
extremely
helpful
whenever
i
have
asked
for
help
.

although
the
apartments
are
facing
stokes
street
and
close
to
the
bascom
light
rail
,
the
location
is
surprisingly
quiet
.

i
have
never
had
any
problems
with
loud
neighbors
or
concerns
about
safety
.

the
apartments
are
within
walking
distance
to
trader
joe
's
,
whole
foods
,
and
other
stores
.

the
well
-
equipped
,
clean
gym
is
a
plus
!

great
place
to
live
if
you
work
in
and
around
downtown
san
jose
!

i
interviewed
several
contractors
for
a
kitchen
remodel
.

liberty
construction
shows
up
and
it
's
two
guys
...
all
i
get
is
100
%
sales
pitch
"
we
're
the
best
...
we
're
number
50
so
we
must
be
doing
something
right
...
look
at
all
these
certificates
that
say
we
're
great
"
.

not
once
did
i
feel
listened
to
like
they
actually
cared
about
what
i
wanted
,
all
they
were
interested
in
was
me
signing
a
contract
right
then
and
there
.

very
high
pressured
sales
and
with
the
reviews
of
many
others
bad
service
.

i
'm
glad
i
trusted
my
gut
and
did
n't
get
sucked
into
doing
business
with
them
.

find
someone
you
trust
that
actually
hears
you
and
wants
to
do
the
job
right
.

do
n't
waste
your
time
or
money
!

i
took
my
3
year
old
son
here
at
the
weekend
and
to
be
honest
,
apart
from
the
shark
walkway
,
i
thought
it
was
rubbish
and
overpriced
.

even
taking
into
account
the
fact
that
my
3
year
old
wanted
to
run
most
of
the
way
round
,
it
took
us
just
over
one
hour
start
to
finish
.

if
you
have
been
to
the
london
aquarium
i
would
not
even
bother
with
this
.

if
you
are
really
desperate
for
something
to
pass
the
time
and
are
willing
to
shell
out
the
best
part
of
l
30
for
2
two
people
then
go
for
it
.

(
for
some
reason
it
will
not
let
me
rate
it
one
star
-
it
is
not
rated
5
by
me
!
)

cranmore
dental
and
implant
clinic
:
i
could
not
recommend
dr
david
nelson
enough
.

i
had
a
severe
phobia
of
attending
the
dentist
until
i
met
and
was
treated
by
dr
nelson
.

he
instantaneously
put
me
at
ease
and
his
ongoing
treatments
have
been
absolutely
pain
free
.

my
previous
apprehension
has
been
dismissed
and
i
no
longer
have
a
sinking
feeling
when
my
next
appointment
is
due
!

in
addition
to
the
core
treatment
,
dr
nelson
has
impressed
me
further
with
his
concern
and
interest
in
the
well
-
being
of
his
patients
-
his
dental
work
underpinned
by
a
strong
duty
of
care
to
every
patient
.

he
is
always
prepared
to
go
the
extra
mile
to
ensure
that
any
patient
discomfort
is
dealt
with
immediately

pam
gillies

best
salsa
(
hehehe
)

after
my
trees
were
cleaned
up
,
they
gave
me
a
jar
of
salsa
.

the
owner
warned
me
that
it
was
the
best
salsa
i
would
ever
had
,
and
he
was
right
.

no
joke
!

i
hate
to
say
check
them
out
just
for
the
salsa
,
but
james
,
i
need
another
jar
badly
:)
all
kidding
aside
,
they
are
a
very
good
company
,
i
have
a
hard
time
giving
any
service
biz
a
5
star
review
but
they
came
close
.

very
affordable
(
do
n't
call
it
cheap
)
and
their
trimmers
were
quick
and
courteous
when
i
got
home
from
work
.

and
the
salsa
,
be
sure
to
ask
for
a
jar
and
have
plenty
of
chips
around
,
you
will
need
them
.....

dr.
mann
killed
our
pet

yea
,
dr.
mann
ai
n't
so
great
.

we
took
our
beloved
kitty
to
him
and
it
came
back
dead
.

we
live
in
the
sub-division
around
the
corner
and
after
it
happened
and
we
brought
it
up
at
some
neighborhood
gatherings
we
discovered
that
several
people
from
this
neighborhood
alone
had
pets
go
to
dr.
mann
for
surgical
procedures
and
came
back
dead
.

if
you
take
him
here
for
shots
,
no
big
deal
but
i
would
never
let
this
man
apply
anesthetic
to
my
pet
ever
again
.

oh
,
they
also
charged
me
for
the
procedure
(
$
250
)
and
had
the
audacity
to
charge
me
a
$
25
'
disposal
'
fee
.

they
actually
itemized
it
as
a
disposal
fee
.

avoid
at
all
costs
.

one
of
the
worst
places

this
place
and
its
sister
store
peking
garden
are
the
worst
places
to
order
from
.

the
food
was
horrible
not
cooked
like
it
should
be
,
they
got
the
order
wrong
on
a
number
of
occasions
,
and
once
forgot
about
my
order
.

i
had
to
call
back
up
there
two
hours
later
and
the
lady
(
who
claimed
to
be
a
manager
)
said
my
food
was
on
the
way
,
and
she
did
nt
offer
to
compensate
me
in
any
kind
of
way
.

i
waited
another
30
mins
before
receiving
my
food
and
it
was
cold
.

in
my
opinon
this
place
should
be
shut
down
by
the
health
inspector
,
and
anyone
who
is
satisfied
with
there
service
and
food
has
never
eaten
at
a
real
asian
restaurant
.

gone
downhill
since
change
in
ownership

sigh
.

i
used
to
love
this
place
.

but
now
that
they
are
part
of
a
chain
,
service
has
slipped
.

i
am
waiting
longer
at
bna
for
my
pickups
and
last
time
i
parked
with
them
,
they
lost
my
car
key
.

lucky
i
had
a
spare
with
me
!

to
date
they
have
not
made
good
by
either
finding
the
key
or
paying
for
a
new
one
.

(
these
new
car
keys
are
expensive
to
copy
,
you
ca
n't
just
go
to
walmart
.
)

go
to
the
website
for
coupons
and
join
the
club
-
you
can
get
free
parking
.

however
,
with
bna
offering
one
day
of
free
parking
due
to
construction
of
the
new
rental
car
facility
,
it
may
be
cheaper
to
park
at
bna
.

wife
and
i
attempted
to
adopt
a
dog
and
was
nothing
but
frustrating
.

we
arrived
sunday
at
about
230
and
found
a
do
we
really
liked
.

we
were
told
that
we
could
n't
today
because
they
were
closing
soon
.

i
called
the
next
morning
to
let
then
know
my
wife
would
be
driving
in
.

they
gave
me
the
run
around
and
missing
paperwork
only
to
call
back
to
tell
me
someone
else
wanted
her
and
i
would
need
to
come
in
and
put
down
a
deposit
.

i
work
2
hours
away
but
offered
my
card
over
the
phone
.

they
refused
.

terrible
communication
as
well
.

at
one
point
they
told
me
the
dog
had
been
fixed
,
the
next
day
it
had
n't
.

huge
ammount
of
time
wasted
time
and
elevated
blood
pressure
.

college
is
a
joke
and
the
salon
is
a
joke
!

went
to
the
school
here
over
priced
!!!!!!

you
do
not
learn
the
things
you
were
promised
.

you
have
to
bring
in
your
own
models
and
they
have
to
pay
for
you
to
use
them
if
you
do
nt
then
you
can
graduate
!

going
back
after
graduating
you
r
told
you
get
a
discount
on
services
nope
you
do
nt
.

staff
is
under
educated
.

going
there
you
learn
the
school
does
not
care
about
the
services
given
just
about
the
money
.

over
priced
for
students
to
learn
!

beware
of
the
nail
program
you
are
not
taught
to
use
a
nail
drill
at
all
you
learn
the
old
fashioned
way
of
doing
nails
you
will
not
be
able
to
do
well
in
a
salon
!!!

beware
!

you
can
fool
people

this
store
is
proof
that
you
can
fool
people
with
good
advertising
.

they
convince
lots
of
people
that
they
are
a
great
store
,
when
in
fact
they
are
a
very
average
place
at
best
,
they
are
just
another
big
box
store
like
the
others
.

they
offer
sales
that
are
n't
really
sales
,
mislabeled
items
that
make
the
item
sound
like
a
good
deal
when
it
is
n't
,
a
bad
attitude
about
return
items
,
and
on
and
on
.

with
higher
than
average
prices
to
boot
!

so
do
n't
get
taken
in
,
keep
your
eyes
open
if
you
choose
to
shop
here
.

on
the
other
hand
,
the
richmond
ukrops
chain
is
known
for
its
charity
work
,
its
community
action
,
and
its
interest
in
the
public
welfare
.

never
again

do
n't
go
here
unless
you
want
to
sit
,
order
,
eat
and
be
asked
to
leave
all
in
a
matter
of
20
minutes
.

you
wo
n't
even
have
time
to
read
the
entire
menu
before
being
asked
to
order
and
if
you
ask
for
more
time
your
server
will
wait
at
the
table
.

this
is
the
only
place
i
have
ever
eaten
and
been
told
to
leave
because
other
people
were
waiting
.

i
was
told
to
take
my
coffee
to
go
if
i
wanted
to
finish
it
.

oh
,
and
their
liquor
license
was
expired
so
no
bloody
mary
or
mimosas
.

plus
the
drinks
are
self
service
,
have
fun
trying
to
negotiate
the
small
cafeteria
space
to
get
your
coffee
,
juice
or
water
.

go
next
door
to
the
ball
square
cafe
instead
.

i
guess
you
get
what
you
pay
for
.

i
tried
to
stay
here
for
a
few
nights
with
my
girlfriend
,
so
we
asked
for
a
single
queen
bed
.

we
got
there
,
and
we
were
treated
to
the
free
"
upgrade
"
of
a
room
with
two
double
beds
.

since
they
consider
this
an
upgrade
,
they
let
their
other
rooms
fill
up
and
would
not
change
our
room
.

then
we
got
put
in
a
room
with
a
huge
gap
under
the
door
....
right
next
to
the
ice
machine
.

we
could
hear
every
single
thing
that
happened
outside
like
it
was
inside
our
room
.

when
i
finally
found
someone
at
the
desk
who
could
speak
english
,
they
moved
our
room
,
but
we
still
did
not
receive
the
single
queen
we
had
"
reserved
"

i
was
thoroughly
impressed
!

i
had
a
problem
with
the
tile
in
my
bathroom
coming
apart
.

i
called
a
few
different
businesses
in
the
area
to
get
estimates
,
they
were
n't
the
cheapest
i
found
but
very
reasonable
.

the
best
part
is
i
got
my
whole
bathroom
remodeled
for
about
the
same
price
the
other
compan's
were
quoting
just
to
fix
the
shower
tile
and
fixtures
.

they
had
the
work
done
in
about
half
the
time
quoted
which
made
me
and
my
wife
extremely
happy
.

we
have
had
nothing
but
compliments
on
our
bathroom
when
guest
come
over
-
who
would
have
guessed
that
one
?

very
nice
work
and
friendly
guys
too
.

best
money
i
've
spent
on
remodeling
ever
.

i
highly
recommend
any
one
considering
home
repair
to
give
these
guys
a
call
.

new
training
centre
is
excellent

the
award
dance
centre
has
moved
from
its
holderness
road
site
to
a
new
complex
on
chamberlain
road
hull
.

the
new
centre
has
4
studios
planned
and
now
boasts
the
largest
single
dance
floor
area
in
kingston
upon
hull
.

the
classes
cover
all
age
and
skill
ranges
,
with
ballroom
,
latin
,
sequence
,
street
,
disco
,
line
dancing
,
ballet
,
tap
&
jazz
.

we
have
attended
a
ward
dance
centre
for
over
a
year
and
really
enjoy
the
friendly
and
welcoming
way
we
are
taught
ballroom
and
latin
as
well
as
the
fun
filled
social
dance
evening
held
every
saturday
evening
....

it
is
not
really
possible
to
score
this
school
too
highly
,
we
would
give
it
12
out
of
10
and
5
stars
across
the
board
steve
&
anne

i
purchased
a
2
-
year
old
certified
pre-owned
bmw
from
this
dealership
.

the
night
i
drove
back
home
,
i
found
that
the
rear
window
has
some
leakage
.

(
you
can
hear
the
wind
while
driving
on
highway
.

very
likely
it
needs
a
new
window
seal
)
.

i
admit
that
i
should
have
paid
attention
to
this
kind
of
little
things
while
test
drive
.

(
but
this
is
a
certified
car
from
a
dealer
.
)

so
i
brought
the
car
back
the
second
day
.

they
told
me
that
this
is
not
under
warranty
and
want
to
charge
me
$
175
just
to
diagnose
the
problem
!

who
knows
how
much
they
want
me
to
pay
to
fix
this
thing
.

i
walked
away
.

so
my
advice
is
that
never
trust
this
dealer
.

stay
away
as
far
as
possible
.

perfect
practice

after
i
had
chosen
the
fountain
dental
practice
they
provided
a
slick
and
professional
service
from
start
to
finish
.

everyone
was
friendly
from
the
receptionist
to
the
surgeon
herself
,
putting
me
at
my
ease
and
explaining
the
whole
process
,
both
initially
and
then
as
we
went
along
.

surgery
visit
timings
were
always
made
to
suit
me
and
not
them
and
they
gave
me
the
feeling
that
i
mattered
and
was
important
to
them
.

the
surgery
itself
is
slick
,
modern
and
very
relaxed
and
i
always
felt
that
i
was
in
capable
hands
.

my
dental
surgeon
,
dr.
lucy
nichols
is
clearly
a
dental
perfectionist
and
clearly
proud
both
of
the
work
she
does
and
the
reputation
she
has
established
.

everyone
was
so
helpful
that
i
can
not
wait
to
go
back
.....

wonderful
service
for
large
group

i
had
my
wedding
luncheon
at
this
bj
s
restaurant
,
and
it
was
one
of
the
best
choices
that
i
made
.

it
was
a
great
deal
--
we
paid
a
certain
amount
per
person
,
and
my
husband
and
i
chose
4
types
of
pizza
and
the
servers
brought
out
as
much
as
we
wanted
.

we
were
also
served
salad
and
soda
.

we
had
a
large
party
,
about
fifty
people
or
so
,
and
yet
everything
was
served
quickly
and
we
all
had
a
wonderful
time
.

even
though
we
were
only
supposed
to
have
those
specific
types
of
pizza
,
when
guests
asked
for
a
different
type
,
it
was
brought
out
with
no
charge
to
us
!

i
really
appreciate
bj
s
for
making
that
special
day
even
better
with
their
wonderful
food
and
service
.

wonderful

i
went
to
ohm
after
reading
some
of
the
reviews
.

i
go
to
school
in
the
area
and
usually
wait
until
i
go
home
to
get
my
hair
cut
.

i
decided
it
was
time
to
grow
up
and
made
an
appointment
.

sierra
was
my
stylist
and
i
love
what
she
did
.

i
have
wavy
hair
and
she
cut
to
my
hair
style
.

it
was
the
first
time
i
had
left
a
salon
with
my
hair
curly
.

usually
they
blow
dry
it
out
and
i
have
to
wait
until
i
wash
it
to
see
what
it
will
look
like
in
its
natural
state
.

but
she
did
a
fabulous
job
letting
me
know
what
she
was
doing
at
all
times
and
styled
my
hair
in
a
way
i
could
do
it
at
home
.

it
was
n't
completly
impossible
!!!!

i
am
definitely
going
back

after
recently
relocating
to
south
bend
,
we
were
looking
for
a
delicious
,
fun
,
yet
elegant
establishment
for
new
year
s
eve
dinner
.

we
were
disappointed
with
this
holiday
dinner
due
to
the
overall
flavor
and
price
of
the
meal
,
and
accessibility
to
the
jazz
club
.

the
meal
was
extremely
overpriced
and
lacked
flavor
,
especially
for
being
a
special
nye
menu
.

the
limited
menu
had
few
appetizing
options
and
the
nye
special
packages
were
way
overpriced
.

after
our
meal
,
our
server
found
us
a
table
in
the
jazz
club
where
we
were
informed
it
would
be
another
$
10
/
person
to
stay
and
listen
to
the
band
,
despite
the
fact
we
had
just
finished
a
dinner
there
and
were
intending
to
enjoy
their
drink
list
.

this
was
a
less
than
impressive
experience
at
trio
's
.

run
for
the
hills
...
you
'll
be
much
better
off
!

one
night
was
too
much
.

first
room
had
used
tissues
next
to
the
bed
and
i
requested
it
be
rectified
.

i
was
then
moved
to
another
room
around
the
back
where
the
room
was
dirty
,
the
shower
was
dirty
with
other
people
s
hair
in
it
,
the
toilet
seat
was
peeling
and
rough
and
the
bathroom
was
full
of
mould
.

i
called
reception
to
ask
if
they
knew
the
state
the
room
was
in
and
was
told
"
this
is
a
days
inn
,
not
the
hilton
"
and
the
receptionist
then
hung
up
on
me
.

to
warn
you
to
stay
away
from
this
place
just
is
n't
enough
.

there
was
not
one
ounce
of
caring
involved
and
anyone
i
can
warn
about
the
complete
lack
of
service
will
be
warned
.

grocery
and
daily
needs
store

before
using
fusionretail
before
installing
fusionretail
store
was
running
on
a
dos
based
software
.

we
were
having
a
major
problem
in
maintaining
cash
.

being
a
grocery
shop
,
maintaining
5000
different
products
was
a
challenging
job
.

managing
pos
counter
without
barcoding
was
really
a
tough
time
.

how
fusionretail
has
overcome
these
issues
?

fusionretail
helps
us
to
maintain
the
store
in
an
organised
way
.

usage
of
product
barcodes
and
smooth
maintenance
of
inventory
with
proper
recording
of
transactions
like
sale
,
purchase
and
returns
was
never
easy
before
.

how
long
does
it
take
to
train
new
people
at
work
?

billing
takes
15
minutes
and
back

takes

how
fast
your

.

on

,
it
takes
a
day
to
get
our
issues
resolved
.

ca
n't
wait
to
go
back
!!!

this
is
by
far
the
best
b&b
that
we
have
ever
stayed
at
!

we
were
in
santa
fe
for
a
special
event
and
our
hosts
rented
out
the
el
paradero
for
all
their
guests
to
stay
at
.

we
could
not
have
been
more
welcomed
,
more
comfortable
or
more
well
fed
.

the
weekend
was
perfect
in
every
way
,
in
large
part
to
sue
and
her
great
staff
.

everyone
was
so
friendly
and
really
went
out
of
their
way
to
make
sure
everything
went
well
.

we
can
not
wait
to
go
back
to
santa
fe
and
to
this
great
b&b
...
especially
my
4
year
old
,
who
made
friends
with
ms.
sue
and
all
the
ladies
,
and
has
talked
about
them
since
we
left
!

we
would
highly
recommend
the
el
paradero
on
your
next
trip
to
santa
fe
!

disatisfied
customer
,
i
went
through
kitchen
aid
and
used
one
of
their
recommended
vendors
.

a&e
came
out
,
charged
$
129
fee
just
to
walk
in
the
door
.

i
needed
a
part
for
my
appliance
,
the
cost
was
very
high
so
i
said
never
mind
,
paid
the
fee
and
called
a
local
business
for
a
second
quote
.

the
second
vendor
charged
$
55
(
less
than
half
of
what
a&e
charges
)
to
come
and
applied
that
to
the
price
of
the
repair
service
(
which
a&e
does
not
)
.

their
quote
came
in
at
half
the
price
of
a&e
for
the
same
work
and
same
part
.

seems
to
me
like
a&e
charges
way
more
than
necessary
!

very
disappointed
in
kitchen
aid
as
well
,
i
thought
that
they
pre-screened
their
vendors
for
price
and
quality
of
work
,
obviously
they
do
not
!

lovely
nails
on
cayuga
st.
in
lewiston
,
ny

first
let
me
start
out
by
saying
,
that
i
have
had
very
nice
pedicures
at
lovely
nails
on
military
road
.

i
was
very
excited
that
a
salon
was
opening
in
lewiston
,
as
i
live
in
youngstown
.

i
was
in
two
weeks
ago
and
had
the
worst
pedicure
that
i
have
had
in
my
life
.

there
were
four
of
us
and
i
was
taken
first
by
a
gentleman
.

i
put
my
foot
in
the
water
and
it
was
cool
.

he
did
warm
it
up
.

he
also
hurt
my
toes
will
pushing
my
cuticles
back
.

if
the
pedicure
lasted
20
mins.
,
that
was
a
stretch
.

the
other
ladies
had
a
similar
experience
,
both
had
nail
polish
on
a
couple
of
toes
.

none
of
us
will
be
using
their
services
again
,
which
is
a
shame
.

good
service
-
limited
results

andrew
was
helpful
and
knowledgeable
about
acupuncture
re
:
infertility
.

he
was
willing
to
talk
to
me
about
my
specific
issues
and
develop
a
plan
of
action
.

the
office
is
shared
with
a
foot
doctor
and
it
's
very
sterile
and
medical
feeling
,
which
i
liked
.

the
down
side
was
that
sometimes
there
was
a
lot
of
noise
in
the
hallway
from
other
patients
/
doctors
.

i
worked
with
andrew
for
2
months
and
did
acupuncture
and
herbs
.

the
sessions
were
nice
and
i
felt
relaxed
after
them
but
did
not
notice
any
changes
with
my
cycles
.

i
know
it
can
take
a
while
for
results
and
did
n't
expect
a
miracle
,
but
after
2
months
i
felt
like
it
was
not
entirely
worth
the
cost
/
time
.

(
i
am
also
a
little
suspicious
of
all
these
glowing
reviews
...
)

friendly
,
clean
and
excellent
location

the
staff
was
very
helpful
,
and
gave
us
good
advice
on
day
and
night
time
activities
.

common
room
was
comfortable
and
clean
,
very
good
room
to
read
or
relax
.
-

a
great
breakfast
which
was
included
every
morning
until
9:30
am
;
yummy
fresh
parisian
croissants
.

comfortable
and
clean
beds
,
a
bit
noisy
when
people
were
coming
in
late
from
a
night
out
,
but
we
did
n't
mind
too
much
as
we
were
also
just
coming
in
from
a
night
out
!

the
location
is
really
stellar
!

it
is
next
to
gare
du
nord
and
a
five
minute
walk
to
sacre
coeur
which
is
excellent
for
shopping
.

it
is
close
to
bus
lines
for
opera
plaza
,
galleries
lafayette
,
and
the
famous
flea
market
.

we
really
enjoyed
our
stay
and
would
definitely
stay
at
the
vintage
hostel
again
.

just
autos
thank
you
!

was
fast
and
easy
,
just
had
our
car
returned
this
morning
,
i
would
recommend
these
mobile
mechanics
for
sure
.

they
certainly
know
what
they
are
doing
.

the
mechanic
came
to
our
place
and
sorted
out
our
car
s
problems
,
he
explained
the
problem
and
was
very
up
front
and
honest
,
it
was
towed
to
the
workshop
as
the
gearbox
was
not
working
(
he
explained
it
better
)
.

they
phoned
the
same
day
,
confirmed
it
was
the
gearbox
quoted
me
the
job
,
i
gave
the
go
ahead
.

now
my
car
s
gears
and
brakes
have
never
run
so
well
...
ever
it
s
like
driving
a
new
car
.

so
yes
,
i
would
n't
hesitate
in
recommending
the
team
at
just
autos
for
easy
professional
car
repairs
,
thank
you
just
autos
for
your
help
.

i
stopped
in
today
@
yards
brewery
.

i
must
say
,
i
was
impressed
with
the
size
of
the
bar
area
and
lounge
,
&
i
liked
that
you
could
see
the
brewery
right
thru
the
glass
!

i
had
a
sampler
of
ipa
,
brawler
,
love
stout
&
esa
.

all
were
awesome
,
&
i
had
a
dogwood
grilled
cheese
which
was
enjoyable
with
the
fine
beers
.

after
my
sampler
&
sandwich
,
i
asked
for
a
pint
of
there
nitrogen
love
stout
,
i
must
say
i
was
impressed
,
with
the
great
taste
&
i
am
a
guiness
lover
so
coming
from
me
,
i
think
this
is
better
,
it
s
less
dry
&
smoother
!

if
you
are
in
philly
you
have
to
come
check
this
place
out
!

the
only
negative
i
have
abou
this
place
is
the
parking
!

i
left
with
a
case
of
brawler
!!!!

oil
change
disaster

my
wife
had
taken
her
'07
ford
fusion
in
for
a
routine
oil
change
.

a
couple
days
after
the
oil
change
,
the
engine
ran
rough
,
the
low
oil
pressure
light
would
come
on
sporadically
,
and
the
engine
would
whir
loudly
.

turns
out
the
engine
had
no
oil
,
and
when
oil
was
put
it
,
it
would
just
run
out
of
the
filter
.

there
could
have
(
hopefully
does
n't
have
)
major
damage
to
the
engine
.

all
of
this
started
after
their
oil
change
.

once
they
realized
their
mistake
they
sent
a
mechanic
and
tow
truck
to
my
wife
's
work
and
towed
it
back
to
fix
it
.

i
would
not
recommend
this
shop
for
anything
,
not
even
something
as
simple
as
an
oil
change
.

plus
they
will
overcharge
you
for
just
about
everything
,
and
smile
while
doing
it
.

liars
,
negative
stars
!

took
my
cruze
in
twice
for
poor
fuel
economy
.

the
first
time
they
claimed
to
get
reasonable
mpg
.

however
,
they
would
never
drive
the
car
with
me
in
it
to
prove
their
findings
.

i
wonder
if
they
were
going
down
a
hill
!

they
told
me
to
bring
it
back
after
5000
miles
.

i
brought
it
back
with
9000
miles
.

they
"
finished
"
the
work
and
told
me
the
car
was
ready
.

i
found
out
they
did
not
even
drive
the
car
,
stated
they
looked
at
it
before
.

they
still
would
not
drive
the
car
with
me
to
show
their
mpg
number
.

they
also
claimed
not
to
see
anything
wrong
with
the
blower
fan
(
a
seperate
issue
)
,
but
when
i
drove
the
car
home
i
had
the
same
symptoms
.

i
will
never
purchace
another
vehicle
from
vic
canever
.

great
job

i
want
to
say
that
mike
did
a
great
job
for
our
family
in
our
time
of
need
.

both
my
grandparents
passed
away
4
months
apart
and
mike
was
very
understanding
.

it
was
a
very
trying
time
for
my
family
and
myself
yet
mike
took
the
time
to
greet
each
and
every
one
one
of
us
.

he
is
very
professional
in
his
position
as
a
director
and
yet
he
still
made
time
to
be
compassionate
for
what
we
were
all
going
through
.

i
'm
sure
it
s
not
every
day
that
a
funeral
director
sees
the
same
family
in
such
a
short
time
.

my
grandfather
passed
away
silently
in
his
sleep
,
and
my
grandmother
passed
away
after
a
short
struggle
with
cancer
.

both
my
grandparents
looked
as
natural
as
could
be
expected
.

thank
you
mike
for
all
your
help
professionally
and
personally
.

poor
service

if
you
like
the
drama
described
in
popular
sitcom
'
seinfeld
'
,
you
will
see
it
here
.

we
signed
our
name
in
about
6:00
pm
.

there
were
3
names
before
us
.

the
greeter
said
there
was
about
15
minutes
waiting
.

however
,
we
waited
and
waited
and
in
the
mean
time
,
saw
4
groups
of
people
simply
just
paraded
in
without
signing
there
names
.

this
sign
in
policy
is
posted
by
the
restaurant
"
no
reservation
,
sign
your
name
here
"
.

i
had
to
ask
the
greeter
,
he
explained
his
reasons
with
broken
english
.

i
could
not
understand
any
his
reasons
.

i
could
only
take
it
as
they
would
seat
the
people
they
know
first
.

my
conclusion
is
that
you
should
only
go
there
if
you
want
to
wait
a
least
an
hour
and
see
all
kinds
other
people
being
seated
before
you
.

instructor
never
showed
up
!

january
15th
--
we
were
signed
up
for
saturday
's
2
pm
class
"
beginning
yoga
with
brittany
.
"

we
even
arrived
10
minutes
early
as
the
website
suggests
.

the
instructor
did
not
show
up
!

we
waited
until
2:25
pm
and
then
left
.

there
were
2
in
our
group
,
and
a
3rd
person
was
also
in
the
parking
lot
waiting
for
this
class
.

well
,
not
much
i
can
say
except
i
'm
very
disappointed
with
this
experience
.

this
was
our
first
visit
to
your
studio
.

in
today
's
instant
world
,
there
's
no
reason
for
the
instructor
not
to
even
have
given
us
a
phone
call
or
e-mail
if
she
was
going
to
be
late
.

as
a
yoga
studio
,
i
'm
sure
you
're
all
aware
that
all
actions
generate
karma
.

and
sometimes
karma
can
manifest
itself
on
a
bad
review
on
google
.

finest
??

really
??

i
beg
to
differ
.

this
place
is
marginal
at
best
.

not
very
welcoming
and
focused
mostly
on
keeping
little
kids
entertained
.

i
was
not
impressed
,
and
quite
frustrated
at
their
lack
of
rating
for
their
courses
.

i
understand
not
wanting
to
put
labels
like
5.10
on
an
indoor
course
,
because
yes
,
it
is
not
the
same
,
but
some
clear
understanding
of
the
difficulty
of
one
course
to
another
is
nice
when
you
are
an
intermediate
climber
looking
to
improve
.

i
do
n't
want
to
waste
my
time
on
routes
set
for
children
,
but
i
do
n't
want
to
take
on
something
i
ca
n't
handle
just
to
strain
myself
to
exhaustion
.

rate
the
routes
,
with
understandable
markings
and
a
more
detailed
system
than
easy
,
moderate
,
and
hard
.

again
,
a
great
outing
for
the
kids
,
a
frustration
for
an
out
of
town
climber
.

best
dj's
in
town
!

wow
!

these
guys
were
the
best
.

they
were
thorough
,
high
class
,
and
went
above
and
beyond
.

we
never
had
to
worry
about
a
thing
,
and
they
led
the
way
the
whole
time
.

they
asked
us
things
that
we
would
have
never
have
thought
of
,
and
took
extra
time
to
meet
with
us
when
we
needed
it
before
the
wedding
.

having
a
team
was
the
best
because
they
kept
the
flow
of
the
wedding
going
the
whole
time
!

they
may
look
young
but
do
n't
let
that
fool
you
,
as
their
knowledge
of
music
far
surpassed
what
we
expected
.

i
am
a
music
junkie
that
grew
up
in
the
80's
,
and
my
dad
worked
for
a
record
label
in
the
1960's
.

so
we
did
n't
expect
them
to
even
know
some
of
the
requests
that
we
asked
that
night
.

they
just
really
know
their
stuff
!

never
fear
going
to
the
dentist
again
!

i
'm
61
years
old
and
have
dental
problems
my
entire
life
.

by
the
age
of
24
i
stopped
going
to
the
dentist
.

my
fear
and
discomfort
from
dental
work
scared
me
!

it
took
all
the
courage
i
could
muster
to
make
an
appointment
.

at
the
front
door
of
his
office
,
i
nearly
turned
around
.

i
considered
just
leaving
after
going
inside
and
nearly
did
.

doctor
gonzales
and
his
entire
staff
are
the
most
professional
people
i
have
ever
dealt
with
.

they
made
me
feel
confident
in
what
they
would
do
,
and
treated
me
like
a
member
of
their
own
family
.

i
never
felt
pain
or
discomfort
.

the
ability
to
smile
and
eat
again
can
only
be
described
as
a
whole
new
lease
on
life
.

thank
you
doctor
gonzales
,
doctor
stout
,
eva
marie
and
the
entire
staff

horrible
service
and
food

not
only
is
this
place
too
expensive
for
what
it
is
,
it
s
horrible
!

in
the
past
,
i
got
a
steak
and
there
was
more
fat
and
rough
pieces
than
there
was
good
steak
(
and
this
was
the
sirloin
!
)
,
the
sides
were
drenched
with
butter
and
the
salad
was
a
little
on
the
brown
side
.

today
we
went
for
a
party
(
during
lunch
,
so
the
place
was
empty
)
with
about
25
other
people
.

it
took
over
1.5
hours
for
our
food
to
come
out
and
by
that
time
my
8
month
old
had
it
!

does
it
seriously
take
that
long
for
a
soup
and
salad
?

i
was
a
waitress
for
years
and
a
key
rule
is
to
serve
customers
with
small
children
before
others
,
as
i
was
the
last
to
get
my
food
.

i
would
not
recommend
having
a
party
here
or
even
going
here
.

texas

way
better

spay
and
neuter
service
.

i
have
no
doubt
that
the
rescue
is
wonderful
.

but
i
had
my
cat
spayed
through
their
reduced
/
free
spay
and
neuter
program
and
the
vet
they
sent
us
to
was
first
of
all
a
hour
and
a
half
away
,
and
4
days
later
we
had
to
bring
them
to
our
normal
vet
because
the
vets
at
the
place
in
wisconsin
did
a
crappy
job
and
they
got
infections
.

my
vet
even
said
it
was
not
my
fault
it
was
the
vet
that
did
the
surgery
,
so
i
would
not
recommend
getting
that
program
unless
you
have
an
extra
hundred
dollars
or
so
for
antibiotics
and
a
vet
visit
.

you
'd
think
they
would
do
a
good
job
but
they
do
n't
care
unless
they
are
getting
paid
full
price
.

which
is
so
dumb
.

not
to
mention
the
fact
that
they
gave
us
our
cats
back
not
even
30
minutes
after
they
were
out
from
surgery
.

billing
issues
...

i
had
a
routine
surgery
for
an
ingrown
toenail
.

my
insurance
company
,
blue
cross
/
blue
shield
paid
the
fees
and
everything
was
fine
.

then
i
got
a
bill
for
$
483.00
.

the
doctor
's
office
said
that
payments
had
been
"
reversed
"
.

blue
cross
has
no
record
of
aa
reversal
.

the
office
refused
my
requests
to
see
what
they
got
from
bc
/
bs
.

they
eventually
turned
it
over
to
a
collection
agency
and
now
will
not
even
discuss
the
matter
.

i
eventually
decided
to
just
pay
the
balance
even
though
the
doctor
has
already
been
paid
,
but
now
the
collection
agency
is
trying
to
say
another
reversal
of
$
160.00
has
come
through
.

it
was
an
ingrown
toenail
.

how
much
could
it
possibly
cost
?

not
only
am
i
being
bilked
for
money
i
do
not
owe
,
the
office
staff
is
rude
to
boot
.

i
think
this
office
has
some
serious
billing
practice
issues
!

we
have
been
blessed
to
find
elite
flyers
online
and
would
not
use
anyone
else
to
handle
our
postcards
,
posters
,
etc
.

we
were
looking
for
a
company
with
decent
rates
as
our
company
was
just
getting
started
.

they
have
the
best
rates
and
great
customer
service
.

on
one
order
,
we
needed
it
rushed
and
shipped
to
a
different
state
.

they
did
that
with
no
problem
.

i
also
appreciate
their
honesty
.

i
sent
a
graphic
that
would
have
been
distorted
if
printed
as
it
was
.

they
called
and
worked
with
me
to
fix
it
so
that
it
would
look
perfect
.

they
recently
surprised
me
a
larger
order
.

i
ordered
1000
postcards
,
we
normally
order
5000
or
more
.

because
they
had
room
to
do
5000
,
they
created
the
larger
amount
,
and
shipped
them
early
.

i
recommend
this
company
to
anyone
and
everyone
that
needs
great
work
done
at
a
reasonable
rate
!

they
have
a
customer
for
life
in
us
!

sheisters

i
made
the
mistake
of
buying
from
these
thieves
.

i
paid
2
k
cash
for
a
truck
with
a
blown
motor
.

their
so
called
mechanic
said
the
engine
was
good
and
"
there
is
nothing
mechanicly
wrong
with
this
truck
"
.

well
i
think
a
blown
engine
falls
under
the
catagory
of
mechanics
right
?

anyway
they
jimmy
rigged
it
so
i
could
drive
it
home
.

the
next
day
i
took
it
to
2
auto
shops
and
they
both
told
me
the
same
thing
,
engine
is
junk
.

i
called
and
got
the
same
runaround
on
hold
and
noone
calls
you
back
.

from
a
moral
standpoint
,
you
guys
are
really
gon
na
take
2,000
bucks
from
someone
that
needs
that
truck
to
work
and
support
his
family
when
you
know
it
s
just
a
piece
of
scrap
metal
?

if
it
lasted
1
month
i
could
suck
it
up
but
1
day
?

you
guys
do

pumpkin
spice
latte
break
at
starbucks
.

it
's
an
adorable
little
store
filled
with
lots
of
stationery
goodness
.

cards
,
wrapping
paper
,
paper
,
and
an
area
to
sit
down
and
talk
with
someone
to
design
your
own
invitations
or
for
whatever
else
your
custom
printing
needs
may
be
.

i
gave
the
woman
i
spoke
with
today
a
"
you
've
been
yelped
!
"
card
to
let
her
know
that
yelp
may
be
a
good
tool
for
helping
spreading
the
word
about
papeluna
.

i
ended
up
buying
a
birthday
card
and
would
probably
come
back
for
more
.

watch
out
for
your
wallet
!

this
company
is
overpriced
for
their
services
.

they
pride
themselves
on
being
an
event
and
team
building
company
for
corporate
clients
but
you
better
believe
they
are
going
to
mark
you
up
on
that
feel
good
premise
.

on
a
recent
event
quote
that
i
had
done
,
they
came
in
thousands
of
dollars
over
their
local
competition
.

the
craziest
part
is
that
they
are
n't
even
based
locally
at
the
city
i
'm
in
-
they
just
have
'
teams
'
in
areas
through
the
country
.

i
've
spoken
to
vendors
who
are
used
by
them
who
had
nothing
good
to
say
about
the
company
as
well
and
in
fact
were
afraid
to
quote
events
against
them
even
though
they
openly
admitted
that
they
felt
canadian
outback
was
pricing
their
entertainment
out
of
the
market
and
doing
more
to
hurt
their
business
than
help
them
.

be
warned
-
they
'll
ltake
you
for
everything
they
can
.

believe
me
.

this
is
the
premier
university
in
virginia
.

it
is
also
the
largest
.

with
a
pizza
hut
,
ihop
,
3
starbucks
,
chili
s
,
panera
,
and
chipotle
on
campus
alone
,
vcu
has
some
of
the
best
eating
options
for
students
.

vcu
has
the
1
art
school
in
america
,
and
excels
in
healthcare
and
medical
schooling
.

the
rams
,
the
vcu
sports
team
,
also
made
the
ncaa
final
4
this
year
,
too
!

vcu
also
offers
high
-
rise
living
for
students
and
professors
,
and
the
historic
yet
fixed
-
up
houses
in
the
fan
are
also
available
to
students
,
professors
,
or
even
people
wanting
to
live
in
a
safe
,
viable
community
.

vcu
is
also
minutes
from
downtown
richmond
,
canal
walk
,
carytown
,
stony
point
,
short
pump
,
and
the
vcu
medical
center
.

it
is
the
best
university
in
virginia
and
continuously
receives
rave
reviews
every
year
.

the
u
of
r
is
also
recommended
,
too
!

orr
's
a
nightmare
!

do
n't
go
!

my
boyfriend
and
i
were
woken
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
at
our
campsite
by
drunken
kids
who
'd
arrived
around
1:00
am
and
were
drinking
at
the
springs
.

when
we
complained
to
the
management
(
as
we
were
instructed
to
do
if
there
were
any
problems
)
,
nothing
happened
!

then
,
the
next
morning
,
when
we
,
among
many
other
irate
guests
,
asked
to
speak
to
the
owner
,
he
refused
to
do
so
.

not
only
that
,
but
he
told
us
,
via
his
manager
,
that
it
was
our
responsibility
to
get
up
a
second
time
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
call
the
night
staff
if
the
problem
continued
,
even
though
his
manager
did
nothing
the
first
time
to
stop
the
kids
.

orr
is
not
relaxing
,
it
's
not
a
safe
space
,
and
the
owner
is
awful
.

to
add
insult
to
injury
,
he
refused
to
refund
our
money
.

do
n't
go
!

fhs
is
a
good
high
school
--
c
/
o
1998

i
enjoyed
my
time
at
franklin
high
school
.

we
had
relatively
good
facilities
at
the
time
--
decent
science
labs
,
with
multiple
hoods
and
access
to
good
equipment
;
nice
gymnasiums
,
and
a
well
-
funded
music
department
(
i
was
in
the
guitar
ensemble
)
.

now
,
of
course
,
there
's
a
new
building
,
with
presumably
better
facilities
.

all
to
the
good
.

for
those
who
care
,
a
good
proportion
of
the
my
class
went
on
to
4
-
year
colleges
,
many
of
them
ranked
in
the
top
50
of
us
news
.

if
i
remember
,
students
went
to
dartmouth
,
u.
penn
,
duke
,
bu
,
william
and
mary
,
vassar
,
howard
,
and
carnegie
mellon
,
among
others
.

many
students
went
to
rutgers
,
including
their
top
-
ranked
pharmacy
program
.

the
point
is
--
fhs
gives
you
the
opportunity
to
make
it
to
a
good
college
,
but
you
need
to
work
hard
.

absolutely
the
best
little
motel
on
the
coast
!

i
've
stayed
at
this
fabulous
little
motel
two
years
running
,
and
i
have
to
say
it
's
one
of
the
best
lodging
experiences
i
've
ever
had
on
the
coast
...
and
i
'm
even
comparing
it
to
the
big
resorts
i
've
stayed
at
!

a
large
group
of
my
friends
and
i
rent
almost
the
whole
motel
every
year
for
a
weekend
,
and
the
experience
and
stay
have
always
been
five
-
star
.

the
rooms
are
so
clean
,
the
managers
/
owners
are
the
nicest
people
,
the
place
feels
so
homey
,
and
the
location
and
grounds
are
beautiful
.

there
's
a
restaurant
nearby
(
walking
distance
)
with
a
great
breakfast
,
and
a
market
across
the
street
.

the
motel
is
very
well
maintained
,
and
the
managers
are
so
accomodating
,
it
's
kind
of
like
visiting
family
each
year
!
;-)

i
honestly
ca
n't
rave
enough
about
this
place
...
it
's
really
a
hidden
gem
worth
checking
out
!

my
favorite
cuban
cafe
in
orlando

i
have
been
eating
cuban
for
a
long
time
,
sandwiches
mainly
along
with
other
dishes
..

i
love
cuban
coffee
,
colada
...
mmmm
anyways
i
found
this
place
and
ca
n't
stop
going
there
,
i
stop
in
at
least
once
a
week
and
anytime
i
'm
in
the
area
for
a
cuban
coffee
or
snack
.

the
place
is
chill
and
comfortable
.

they
do
n't
speak
the
best
english
but
enough
to
get
by
.

they
bake
bread
fresh
daily
,
they
do
n't
press
their
sandwiches
which
is
the
way
i
like
it
,
and
the
meat
is
always
fresh
.

they
have
a
great
lunch
special
with
your
choice
of
meat
,
chicken
,
steak
,
or
pork
and
rice
and
black
beans
and
fried
plantains
.

and
their
breakfast
is
awesome
!!

i
can
not
describe
how
delicious
the
mango
and
cheese
pastries
and
the
omelets
are
to
die
for
.

stop
in
and
have
a
bite
you
wo
n't
regret
it
.

a
slice
of
heaven
in
winter
park
off
forsyth
!

highly
recommended
.

i
have
been
going
to
warner
family
for
a
number
of
years
and
would
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
.

i
've
read
some
of
the
reviews
below
and
would
like
to
state
that
yes
,
like
any
other
doctor
s
office
there
is
sometimes
a
wait
(
depending
on
what
other
patients
are
being
seen
for
)
and
some
of
the
tests
and
procedures
that
are
ran
can
be
costly
(
just
like
they
would
be
for
any
other
medical
tests
elsewhere
if
you
do
not
have
insurance
)
...

i
have
seen
several
of
the
providers
from
the
office
and
have
not
once
been
shown
anything
but
care
and
consideration
.

i
ca
nt
speak
for
them
but
any
tests
or
appointments
they
recommend
are
probably
in
the
best
interests
of
us
(
the
patient
)
and
you
have
the
ability
to
decline
anything
that
they
suggest
to
you
.

i
personally
have
had
wonderful
service
and
if
you
re
truely
looking
for
a
family
practice
...
warner
family
is
the
place
for
you
.

not
what
i
expected
!

we
read
the
good
reviews
before
going
and
had
high
hopes
..
but
to
our
dismay
it
did
nt
turn
out
that
way
!

~
it
took
over
40
mins
to
be
taken
to
our
table
,
once
there
it
took
another
20
mins
to
get
our
orders
and
a
further
45
mins
till
our
starters
landed
on
our
table
.

very
frustrating
for
a
restaurant
that
has
1
rosette
and
is
supposedly
renowned
for
the
service
...
hmm
there
was
no
canape's
or
amuse
to
keep
us
occupied
,
once
we
complained
about
the
wait
they
took
us
something
to
nibble
on
but
that
took
us
getting
out
our
chairs
and
wondering
round
to
do
that
and
it
was
impossible
to
get
anyone
s
attention
.

scallops
were
overcooked
and
the
foie
gras
was
cold
but
the
rest
of
the
food
was
lovely
.

on
top
of
that
though
they
tried
to
charge
us
service
charge
just
to
rub
it
it
....

would
n't
go
back
as
there
are
a
lot
of
places
a
lot
better
and
cheaper
.

nice
selection
,
very
clean
,
friendly
staff
!

hot
iron
has
become
a
favorite
of
our
family
.

everyone
can
get
the
signature
dish
with
ingredients
and
spices
that
they
want
and
have
the
fun
of
watching
it
cook
.

the
staff
are
very
friendly
and
conscientious
.

they
always
ask
if
you
have
meat
in
your
dish
,
(
for
vegetarians
like
me
)
,
they
scrub
an
area
of
the
grill
and
use
separate
utensils
to
cook
.

they
do
n't
just
dump
your
ingredients
on
and
cook
either
,
but
carefully
separate
meat
to
the
hotter
parts
of
the
grill
and
still
manage
to
keep
the
veggies
from
turning
to
mush
.

the
selection
of
meats
,
veggies
and
sauces
is
awesome
too
!

every
time
we
go
they
seem
to
have
a
different
ingredient
or
two
which
keeps
things
interesting
.

meats
are
kept
very
cold
,
seafood
smells
fresh
and
the
serving
bar
is
very
clean
.

prices
are
reasonable
,
(
kid
s
meals
are
around
4.99
)
and
wednesday's
they
have
discount
dinner
prices
,
i
believe
.

great
cookies
,
cakes
,
and
customer
service

it
was
my
birthday
and
i
had
a
last
minute
idea
to
have
a
bakery
cake
instead
of
one
pre-made
in
a
convenience
store
,
but
the
problem
was
it
was
the
day
before
valentine
s
and
when
many
bakeries
turned
me
down
for
a
plain
vanilla
rectangle
cake
,
fiona
stepped
up
to
the
plate
and
was
able
to
make
a
fantastic
beautiful
cake
.

not
only
did
it
taste
wonderful
,
but
the
texture
was
unbelievable
,
the
frosting
was
n't
overly
sweet
to
over
power
the
cake
,
and
the
cake
itself
was
just
amazingly
soft
,
and
fluffy
,
and
just
perfect
overall
.

although
i
'll
have
to
drive
a
little
out
of
my
way
to
go
there
,
i
'll
gladly
do
it
knowing
that
since
she
's
been
astounding
to
me
once
before
that
she
'll
always
be
that
way
!

(
also
she
has
a
really
great
website
!

and
we
bought
a
few
cookies
there
too
,
they
were
fantastic
as
well
!
)

she
deserves
many
5
star
reviews
!!

food
craving
gone
and
weight
loss
at
acupuncture
doctor

i
am
a
college
student
.

before
treatment
,
my
food
cravings
were
"
out
of
control
"
which
caused
me
to
be
stressed
out
.

i
experienced
a
definite
decrease
in
food
craving
(
about
50
%
)
and
decrease
in
stress
after
the
1st
treatment
.

i
actually
loss
4
pounds
after
my
1st
treatment
and
2
pounds
after
my
2nd
treatment
.

i
was
amazed
.

i
am
now
more
at
peace
and
my
food
craving
is
about
99
%
gone
after
only
3
treatments
.

before
coming
to
acupuncture
doctor
i
was
a
big
baby
about
needles
and
only
came
because
my
boyfriend
's
aunt
recommended
it
.

it
hurt
very
little
,
felt
more
like
pressure
than
pain
.

what
i
like
most
about
dr.
liau
is
that
she
is
very
caring
.

she
talks
to
you
at
each
appointment
.

i
can
tell
she
really
cares
and
wants
to
help
.

i
am
so
glad
to
have
found
dr.
liau
.

now
i
feel
more
confident
wearing
my
bathing
suit
in
the
summer
.

an
asset
to
richmond

for
a
long
time
,
one
big
source
of
entertainment
missing
from
the
richmond
city
limits
was
a
first
-
run
multiplex
.

bowtie
has
filled
that
role
nicely
.

the
theatre
is
in
an
old
brick
warehouse
,
which
is
a
block
away
from
the
flying
squirrels
stadium
.

the
owners
of
bowtie
manged
to
add
something
new
while
preserving
what
was
already
there
.

the
theatre
has
greatly
improved
the
surrounding
neighborhood
.

there
's
plenty
of
parking
,
and
i
've
never
had
an
issue
with
audience
members
who
wo
n't
stop
talking
or
answering
their
cellphones
.

best
of
all
,
there
are
no
ads
!!!!
!

just
previews
and
the
main
feature
.

expect
to
pay
full
price
,
and
the
theatres
themselves
are
on
the
small
side
.

but
if
you
like
going
to
the
movies
,
you
should
love
bowtie
.

the
mangers
also
play
a
classic
movies
on
sundays
,
you
can
get
a
beer
in
the
lobby
,
and
repeat
customers
can
get
discounts
if
they
have
a
member
card
.

a
great
cinema
in
a
great
location
.

thank
you
,
bowtie
!

craft
wonderland
with
history

my
first
visit
was
so
fun
yesterday
.

i
could
have
stayed
all
day
and
not
seen
all
the
things
.

i
am
doing
origami
jewelry
and
found
exactly
the
right
things
for
earrings
and
got
many
other
ideas
there
too
.

i
bought
a
beginner
s
quilling
set
and
like
making
the
filigree
forms
you
can
make
and
add
to
other
crafts
.

the
owner
,
jean
,
has
been
there
31
years
!

what
a
history
.

she
is
a
super
sweet
,
lovable
and
well
-
informed
woman
with
a
great
sense
of
humor
.

i
really
enjoyed
meeting
her
and
happy
to
learn
she
comes
from
oklahoma
and
has
the
values
of
a
solid
no
bs
country
girl
.

this
store
is
a
real
gem
and
has
much
to
offer
the
serious
crafter
or
the
occasional
crafter
.

by
the
way
,
salmagundi
(
the
store
name
)
means
something
like
smorgasbord
;
potpourri
;
motley
;
variety
;
mixed
bag
;
miscellaneous
assortment
;
mixture
,
a
variety
of
many
kinds
of
things
.

great
name
for
a
great
store

the
2010
genesis
is
grrrrrrrreeeaaat
!

i
am
a
proud
owner
of
a
brand
new
2010
hyundai
genesis
.

i
have
never
seen
this
car
before
until
this
lady
at
wal
mart
had
it
and
she
told
me
she
got
it
here
and
that
everyone
was
so
nice
to
her
.

i
asked
her
who
she
worked
with
and
she
just
told
me
ti
was
the
sales
manager
.

i
took
the
weekend
off
and
came
in
and
asked
for
the
manager
who
is
jeff
and
he
remembered
her
right
away
even
remembered
her
dog
,
i
was
a
bit
shocked
that
someone
would
pay
that
close
attention
.

we
got
to
talking
and
he
got
me
set
up
and
i
test
drove
with
craig
and
i
fell
head
over
heels
for
this
car
all
i
kept
saying
,
"
was
i
got
ta
have
it
!
"

i
thouhgt
it
would
be
out
of
my
price
range
but
they
really
worked
with
me
and
now
i
could
nt
be
happier
.

jeff
and
craig
are
really
good
at
what
they
do
and
know
exactly
how
to
treat
a
customer
.

definitely
go
see
them
!

bait
and
switch
,
untrained
workers

called
the
bonanza
store
2
weeks
ago
,
before
i
ripped
out
350
sq
ft
of
ceramic
tile
...
was
told
i
would
need
a
"
dual
head
concrete
grinder
"
to
remove
thinset
and
make
a
nice
"
finished
"
look
(
ready
for
concrete
stain
)
.

was
quoted
$
55
all
inclusive
of
grinder
inserts
,
etc
.

no
problem
,
sounded
like
it
's
done
every
day
.

will
look
beautiful
.

got
the
tile
ripped
out
,
call
today
,
now
all
the
sudden
this
grinder
wo
n't
leave
a
finished
look
and
it
's
$
125
plus
around
$
75
for
the
inserts
.

i
can
rent
another
machine
for
like
$
60
that
will
give
it
a
finished
look
.

so
from
$
55
to
$
260
?

are
they
serious
?

i
feel
like
they
did
n't
tell
me
the
pitfalls
before
i
pulled
out
this
tile
and
now
that
i
have
no
other
options
they
want
5
times
the
price
?

either
these
people
do
n't
know
anything
about
what
they
are
renting
,
or
worse
-
they
are
bait
and
switching
.

one
suspects
that
earlier
reviewer
works
for
another
laundry
.

outside
of
parking
being
at
a
premium
,
especially
on
discount
days
,
the
laundry
tub
is
not
filthy
and
it
's
no
smaller
than
any
of
a
dozen
laundromats
i
've
been
in
.

yes
,
there
are
bigger
,
but
bigger
is
n't
necessarily
better
.

i
availed
myself
of
the
wash
'n
fold
service
,
taking
just
about
a
year
's
worth
of
dirty
clothes
in
and
getting
back
neatly
folded
,
clean
clothes
in
clear
plastic
bags
(
i
'd
originally
brought
them
in
,
in
six
large
yellow
garbage
bags
)
.

the
cost
was
certainly
reasonable
and
i
will
continue
my
patronage
of
the
laundry
tub
in
the
future
.

did
n't
hurt
any
that
they
knew
my
name
by
my
second
visit
and
greeted
me
warmly
then
and
on
my
third
visit
.

whereas
my
answer
to
the
question
"
where
do
you
get
your
laundry
done
?
"
used
to
be
,
"
at
the
checkout
line
at
walmart
,
"
i
can
honestly
say
the
answer
now
is
,
"
at
the
laundry
tub
.
"

thank
you
!

i
recently
took
a
rescue
puppy
to
this
clinic
and
i
was
shocked
at
how
well
romeo
and
my
family
was
treated
.

they
worked
around
the
clock
to
ensure
that
my
puppy
life
was
saved
.

we
have
to
leave
him
at
the
vet
for
3
days
and
i
was
told
to
call
for
check
ups
as
often
as
i
wished
that
no
matter
how
many
times
i
called
i
would
not
annoy
them
.

lol
they
where
super
friendly
towards
us
and
treated
us
like
people
not
walking
bags
of
cash
.

in
this
day
it
s
rare
to
find
such
wonderful
people
who
care
,
not
the
kind
of
want
to
make
cash
.

i
would
strongly
suggest
you
give
them
the
chance
to
prove
to
you
that
not
all
people
in
this
world
are
evil
!

i
will
never
go
to
another
vet
as
long
as
i
have
animals
.

i
live
nearly
two
hours
away
and
yet
i
will
still
make
the
drive
to
see
them
!

in
fact
i
look
forward
to
taking
my
animals
to
the
vet
simply
because
of
how
my
animals
and
i
are
treated
.

okay
,
here
's
the
scoop
.

i
'm
a
regular
at
the
hh
.

the
food
is
excellent
,
the
serivce
is
horrible
.

i
think
they
're
still
in
the
mindset
from
when
it
was
only
smokers
sitting
around
and
drinking
...
not
in
any
hurry
.

in
my
experience
the
food
has
been
excellent
(
for
the
most
part
)
.

however
,
the
bartenders
/
waitresses
definately
need
to
be
re-trained
(
if
they
ever
had
any
to
begin
with
)
and
learn
two
things
:
only
chat
with
customers
when
other
customers
are
not
impatiently
waiting
and
to
look
around
more
often
to
see
if
people
are
waiting
.

in
some
cases
the
result
is
because
of
understaffing
,
in
some
cases
the
staff
just
does
n't
care
/
know
better
.

they
must
also
get
something
to
keep
take
-
out
warm
,
so
it
's
not
room
temperature
at
best
when
you
get
it
home
.

you
just
have
to
know
what
you
're
getting
into
when
you
go
.

nice
local
pub
,
excellent
food
(
especially
wings
)
,
and
do
n't
go
if
you
have
a
limited
amount
of
time
.

trust
the
midas
touch

i
personally
trust
this
midas
store
with
all
my
vehicles
,
i
have
been
going
there
for
years
&
would
never
go
anywhere
else
!

the
staff
is
very
personable
&
actually
care
about
the
customers
safety
rather
than
taking
there
money
.

this
is
however
a
very
busy
shop
but
there
are
appointments
available
&
the
staff
up
front
will
surely
make
sure
you
get
back
in
a
timely
manner
.

i
look
at
some
of
these
other
comments
&
laugh
because
people
think
that
the
world
revolves
around
them
!

like
the
girl
with
the
fuse
problem
...

midas
has
the
most
high
tech
equipment
in
town
&
i
guarantee
you
if
they
told
you
it
was
electrical
then
in
deed
it
s
electrical
!

maybe
you
should
understand
how
the
world
works
&
realize
you
are
just
like
any
other
person
&
not
put
yourself
on
a
pedestal
.

i
will
continue
going
to
dave
at
midas
because
he
is
one
of
the
most
honest
business
owners
in
this
town
!

when
having
your
car
worked
on
you
have
to
trust
the
mechanic
&
this
midas
is
truly
someone
you
can
trust
!

we
decided
to
try
this
place
last
night
because
we
noticed
that
it
had
some
interesting
things
on
the
menu
aside
from
the
usual
rolls
--
live
scallop
sashimi
,
duck
breast
nigiri
with
foie
gras
,
panko
mussels
--
but
none
of
these
were
particularly
great
or
worth
the
sticker
price
.

additionally
we
tried
the
logan
circle
roll
,
spicy
crab
and
tuna
roll
,
and
sweet
potato
tempura
roll
(
$
15
,
$
10
,
and
$
3.75
respectively
)
.

the
sweet
potato
tempura
roll
was
actually
a
great
surprise
:
cheap
and
delicious
,
the
only
thing
we
tried
that
i
would
say
was
well
worth
it
and
a
great
value
(
and
i
never
get
vegetarian
rolls
)
.

the
other
rolls
were
n't
at
all
special
,
especially
given
their
pricing
.

the
bottom
line
is
that
the
food
is
n't
great
and
is
relatively
high
-
priced
.

the
service
is
solicitous
,
the
atmosphere
is
nice
and
mod
except
the
out
-
of
-
place
flat
-
screen
tv
playing
football
.

but
i
'd
go
elsewhere
unless
the
prices
are
cut
.

it
's
just
not
worth
it
.

do
n't
expect
sleep
or
courtesy

i
was
booked
for
2
nights
at
this
hotel
in
oct
2007
.

at
3:15
am
on
night
2
,
the
fire
alarm
and
strobe
light
activated
in
my
room
.

these
are
not
household
type
alarms
.

when
they
sound
off
,
it
is
a
true
audio
/
visual
experience
.

i
called
the
front
desk
and
got
no
answer
.

after
checking
for
signs
of
fire
or
smoke
and
seeing
none
,
i
decided
to
just
pack
up
and
leave
.

the
desk
agent
actually
argued
with
me
,
claiming
that
no
such
alarm
had
gone
off
(
as
if
i
would
make
that
up
?
)
.

he
finally
admitted
that
only
the
4
ada
room
alarms
had
sounded
,
so
only
4
guests
were
effected
(
no
big
deal
to
him
)
.

this
little
drip
offered
no
apologies
whatsoever
,
and
even
refused
to
give
me
the
name
of
the
manager
until
i
pressed
him
for
it
3
times
.

this
hotel
is
adequate
enough
,
but
there
is
an
obvious
problem
with
the
staff
and
management
.

do
not
go
there
if
you
expect
to
sleep
through
the
night
.

poor
service
,
lack
of
passion
:
do
not
go

i
began
seeing
dr.
romanick
back
in
2000
and
have
seen
a
significant
decline
in
the
quality
of
care
,
patient
-
doctor
communication
,
and
just
the
overall
level
of
services
.

the
poor
quality
starts
at
the
receptionist
desk
,
where
the
staff
is
very
impatient
and
lack
the
efficiency
i
once
loved
about
the
office
.

it
took
them
nearly
two
months
to
complete
a
simple
task
,
and
countless
calls
from
my
part
due
to
their
lack
of
response
and
passion
(
not
that
it
's
a
requirement
for
the
job
,
but
it
helps
to
at
least
pretend
to
be
helpful
)
.

also
,
i
was
promised
to
have
my
test
results
emailed
to
me
,
but
it
never
happened
,
and
after
a
few
attempts
to
get
dr.
romanick
on
the
phone
to
brief
me
on
my
condition
,
i
finally
gave
up
and
went
to
a
different
doctor
.

please
do
not
go
there
if
it
's
professional
,
friendly
,
diligent
medical
services
you
're
looking
for
.

save
yourself
the
trouble
,
money
and
time
and
visit
a
more
caring
facility
/
doctor
.

the
moving
company
is
actualy
based
in
brooklyn
,
but
advertised
all
over
ny
/
nj
,
including
fort
lee
.

when
the
guys
arrived
(
2
hours
later
than
agreed
)
they
told
that
you
have
to
pay
all
the
tolls
they
payed
coming
from
brooklyn
and
extra
$
100
for
them
to
drive
back
from
your
destination
.

that
was
not
in
agreement
eather
,
but
they
realy
demand
it
.

and
another
$
100
for
wrapping
the
furniture
.

so
totalling
$
212
just
for
start
before
any
work
started
.

guess
what
,
was
not
in
the
initial
agreement
as
well
.

i
was
moving
out
from
2
bdr
apartment
and
it
took
for
3
strong
guys
6
hours
to
load
a
track
(
from
2
pm
-
8
pm
)
.

the
only
reason
i
'm
giving
3
stars
instead
of
1
or
2
,
i
should
admit
,
nothing
was
broken
.

so
i
still
can
recomend
them
but
prepare
pay
twice
as
much
as
they
tell
you
initially
.

one
more
thing
,
they
do
n't
take
any
credit
cards
or
checks
.

you
have
to
pay
cash
only
before
they
start
unloading
track
on
your
destination
.

worst
apartments
ever

we
lived
here
for
2
years
,
the
first
year
or
so
was
okay
.

then
,
the
more
power
they
gave
to
linda
,
the
worse
the
place
got
.

we
were
always
having
our
water
shut
off
,
there
were
always
people
having
parties
at
the
pool
,
even
after
it
was
supposed
to
be
closed
.

the
pool
was
supposed
to
close
at
10
and
they
would
have
people
down
there
until
11:45
yelling
,
playing
music
and
do
who
-
knows
-
what
in
the
dark
corners
of
the
pool
.

then
,
when
we
moved
out
,
we
cleaned
the
apartment
top
to
bottom
,
they
came
back
and
tried
to
charge
us
for
two
cleaning
fees
(
and
we
never
got
our
deposit
back
)
and
past
utilities
(
that
were
already
paid
,
we
have
check
numbers
and
records
of
this
)
.

linda
is
the
rudest
person
you
will
ever
talk
to
and
she
sticks
up
for
all
of
the
trashy
,
rude
people
that
live
there
,
not
the
nice
ones
that
actually
give
a
crap
about
respecting
others
.

do
not
live
here
,
you
will
regret
it
!

the
worst
experience
ever
!!!

i
have
worked
with
ted
jurek
at
decor
and
you
,
and
it
started
out
as
a
decent
experience
.

he
was
referred
to
me
by
a
friend
,
who
did
n't
have
the
best
experience
with
ted
,
but
said
that
ted
was
able
to
make
up
for
his
lack
of
preparedness
at
the
end
.

i
figure
i
would
give
this
company
a
chance
.

however
,
after
giving
a
required
$
500.00
(
non
refundable
)
deposit
before
seeing
any
plans
or
ideas
,
i
was
sorry
i
did
.

we
met
a
couple
of
weeks
later
,
ted
was
late
.

he
brought
fabric
books
,
and
pictures
of
furniture
only
,
which
all
came
way
over
budget
.

by
the
time
we
got
to
the
budget
i
told
him
i
could
work
with
,
there
was
basically
no
design
.

just
curtains
and
a
couple
of
accessories
.

what
is
that
?????

this
company
is
way
too
expensive
with
nothing
to
show
for
it
.

please
everyone
....
take
heed
and
do
n't
get
caught
up
in
the
hype
about
decor
and
you
working
with
every
budget
...

this
is
just
a
way
for
them
to
squirm
their
way
into
your
precious
pocket

horrible
.

horrible
.

when
we
walked
in
,
the
person
behind
desk
said
:
"
oh
well
,
you
must
wait
,
i
am
in
the
middle
of
something
.
"

after
a
good
few
minutes
,
he
asked
:
"
what
do
you
want
?
"

somewhere
in
between
his
rudeness
he
asked
if
we
smoked
.

i
asked
if
this
hotel
had
smoking
rooms
.

he
immediately
said
"
no
,
there
is
a
$
50
deposit
now
!
"

sure
enough
he
charged
it
to
the
credit
card
.

when
i
inquired
he
rudely
replied
"
in
the
morning
when
things
are
checked
out
you
'll
get
it
back
.
"

i
called
customer
service
about
it
because
the
website
specifically
states
that
there
are
no
other
charges
at
the
check
-
in
.

i
also
mentioned
to
the
reception
person
.

he
responded
"
we
have
problem
with
'
people
'
"
.

imagine
a
hotel
having
problems
with
people
.

i
finally
alerted
him
to
his
rudeness
.

he
said
he
's
had
a
long
and
bad
day
.

we
had
no
choice
but
to
stay
but
will
take
this
as
far
as
we
can
.

do
n't
stay
there
.

i
came
to
find
out
the
person
was
the
hotel
owner
also
.

my
friend
and
i
were
to
stay
here
for
a
girls
night
,
catch
up
on
our
lives
evening
.

we
live
within
20
miles
of
the
hotel
and
wanted
to
get
away
from
our
responsibilities
for
the
night
.

unfortunalty
my
husband
and
i
had
to
put
our
13
year
old
lab
down
that
morning
and
we
were
not
expecting
this
.

my
friend
called
the
hotel
to
cancel
our
room
as
soon
as
i
called
her
.

they
said
that
we
were
to
be
charged
for
this
room
regardless
because
we
did
not
cancel
within
the
72
hours
.

i
called
them
back
a
few
hours
after
putting
my
bodhi
down
and
they
still
would
n't
budge
.

times
are
hard
,
i
know
,
but
they
had
no
compassion
.

i
called
3
times
to
talked
to
a
manager
,
never
a
call
back
.

i
emailed
4
times
,
never
a
response
.

in
one
of
the
emails
i
attached
the
letter
from
the
vet
's
that
expressed
their
sympathy
,
this
hotel
did
nothing
.

i
even
emailed
mackinaw
tourist
and
nothing
.

i
am
sure
this
is
a
good
place
to
stay
from
reading
the
other
reviews
,
but
if
something
unexpected
happens
in
your
life
,
they
will
not
care
.

fanfuckingtastic

ok
i
am
a
new
yorker
who
has
been
going
to
school
in
oxford
,
england
.

i
thought
the
uk
was
completely
devoid
of
good
nyc
style
pizza
.

i
thought
to
get
a
decent
pizza
the
only
way
was
at
a
fancy
restaurant
,
and
i
have
to
get
a
whole
pie
.

i
thought
i
would
have
to
wait
until
i
went
home
to
nyc
.

well
then
i
went
on
a
trip
to
glasgow
and
was
walking
around
.

i
saw
this
place
and
it
looked
like
the
holy
grail
.

i
knew
i
had
found
the
real
deal
,
big
pies
,
sold
by
the
slice
,
with
the
pizzas
sitting
under
the
glass
in
the
front
.

they
have
crushed
red
pepper
flakes
and
oregano
.

so
i
ordered
a
slice
.

it
tasted
like
i
just
flew
back
home
.

i
du
n
no
how
they
did
it
,
but
scottish
friends
---
this
is
the
real
deal
.

i
congratulated
this
establishment
for
doing
the
research
on
making
nyc
pizza
because
these
scots
fcking
nailed
it
.

that
being
said
,
i
do
n't
know
how
their
delivery
service
is
.

they
might
want
to
change
the
name
to
reflect
the
new
yorkedness
of
the
pizza
,
scrummy
yummy
sounds
gimmicky
to
me
.

good
food
,
good
wait
staff
,
poor
management

we
visited
on
7/26/08
for
dinner
we
received
a
gift
certificate
for
the
mama
mia
's
on
greenfield
ave
.

the
food
was
good
,
and
so
was
our
waitress
.

when
it
came
time
to
pay
the
bill
up
front
,
they
would
not
let
me
use
any
of
the
certificate
for
a
tip
(
which
i
have
done
with
any
other
restaurant
i
've
gotten
a
gift
certificate
for
.
)

i
then
asked
if
i
could
have
money
back
in
cash
.

the
person
went
to
go
check
with
the
manager
,
who
was
sitting
at
a
table
chatting
with
her
friends
who
were
eating
there
.

her
answer
was
short
and
manner
rather
rude
.

sorry
for
interrupting
i
guess
.

the
cashier
was
also
short
,
unapologetic
and
made
me
feel
as
i
was
wasting
her
time
.

there
were
no
other
options
available
(
i
only
brought
my
check
card
to
cover
any
overage
cost
)
and
she
rang
it
up
and
applied
it
to
the
gift
card
before
telling
me
about
the
tip
policy
.

i
will
not
be
visiting
mama
mia
's
again
.

there
are
other
places
with
food
just
as
good
with
management
that
values
customers
and
employees
much
more
.

dining
at
texas
roadhouse

texas
roadhouse
has
very
good
meals
,
that
the
meat
comes
right
off
the
bones
.

it
has
very
good
prices
.

on
a
bad
note
the
waiting
area
is
not
enjoyable
or
enough
seats
.

also
,
there
should
not
be
peanuts
all
over
the
floor
.

next
,
there
should
only
be
one
person
bringing
you
your
food
.

it
s
not
a
big
deal
but
i
had
to
take
my
salad
home
because
they
forgot
to
bring
it
.

i
had
to
ask
the
girl
who
brought
my
food
and
she
never
came
back
to
let
me
know
.

i
had
to
wait
for
my
waitress
.

when
you
first
come
in
the
hostess
is
not
very
friendly
,
there
is
just
a
bunch
of
workers
standing
there
.

i
was
there
on
march
6th
,
2009
.

i
was
also
there
of
july
4th
2008
,
when
my
daughter
s
buffalo
wings
came
out
with
a
fly
on
it
.

the
manager
came
over
and
said
he
was
sorry
and
gave
a
new
batch
of
wings
,
he
said
we
ca
nt
really
do
anything
because
the
doors
are
always
opening
and
closing
.

in
my
opinion
should
of
just
took
off
the
price
of
the
wings
from
the
bill
.

but
everyone
has
there
own
way
!!!!!!

mezza
luna
ftw
!

their
mezza
luna's
are
deffly
better
than
the
pizza
rolls
.

it
s
like
a
pizza
roll
,
but
they
just
toss
ham
and
cheese
inside
.

it
seems
like
it
s
healthier
too
,
but
it
s
prolly
not
.

also
,
you
can
call
em
ahead
of
time
,
and
then
go
to
pick
up
ur
food
,
or
have
it
delivered
**
.

that
cuts
down
on
teh
wait
time
,
cus
u
can
do
other
stuff
while
u
r
waiting
.

it
usually
takes
20
mins
for
a
mezza
luna
,
as
they
have
to
add
pure
delicious
extract
to
the
mix
.

their
pizza
was
a
little
salty
for
me
,
but
it
s
still
good
.

they
do
that
whole
thing
where
you
sandwich
the
pepperoni
between
layers
of
cheese
for
+
32
delicious
.

anyways
,
the
mezza
luna
:
you
should
try
it
.

it
runs
you
about
4
bucks
and
it
deals
crushing
blows
to
hunger
.

**
edit
:
living
on
campus
at
clarkson
university
,
i
have
had
food
delivered
before
.

this
was
back
between
'05
and
'09
and
i
do
n't
remember
how
many
times
we
've
had
it
delivered
.

perhaps
they
do
n't
deliver
anymore
,
but
the
deliciousness
of
a
mezza
luna
certainly
warrants
a
pickup
.

my
2004
x
-
type
was
getting
close
to
100,000
miles
so
it
was
time
for
an
upgrade
.

i
sent
my
wife
and
daughter
over
to
check
out
a
pre-owned
2009
xf
.

michael
chestney
was
very
pleasant
and
patient
with
my
wife
and
she
suggested
i
go
check
it
out
.

i
went
in
later
that
afternoon
and
met
with
michael
.

he
showed
me
the
car
i
was
interested
in
and
we
took
a
test
drive
.

i
loved
the
car
so
we
began
negotiating
my
trade
-
in
and
the
price
of
the
09
xf
.

the
entire
negotiation
took
about
20
minutes
.

fair
give
and
take
on
both
sides
until
we
agreed
on
a
deal
that
was
within
my
parameters
and
was
fair
to
both
sides
.

10
minutes
of
paperwork
and
i
was
the
owner
of
a
beautiful
pre-owned
09
xf
.

i
have
purchased
over
15
vehicles
(
cars
,
rvs
,
and
boats
)
in
my
lifetime
and
i
have
to
say
the
experience
with
michael
and
barrett
motor
cars
of
san
antonio
was
one
of
the
best
.

friendly
,
knowledgeable
,
and
above
all
fair
.

that
's
all
you
can
really
ask
from
a
car
dealer
and
michael
and
barrett
hit
all
3
.

thanks
for
the
great
deal
and
the
great
car
!

identity
theft

myself
and
my
fiance
's
identity
was
stolen
from
the
office
staff
.

we
were
told
by
a
detective
and
asked
to
check
our
credit
for
anything
unusual
.

luckily
they
caught
the
crooks
before
they
did
one
on
us
.

it
was
a
black
female
that
use
to
work
in
the
office
.

she
stole
the
information
and
gave
it
to
another
guy
that
did
all
the
work
.

the
other
guy
was
pulled
over
one
day
and
a
cop
saw
suspicious
papers
with
names
and
social
security
numbers
on
it
.

that
s
how
they
were
caught
.

they
both
went
to
jail
and
a
new
manager
was
put
in
charge
of
the
apartments
.

the
apartment
across
from
mine
belonged
to
a
gang
of
hookers
.

nobody
lived
there
.

a
girl
would
show
up
,
then
a
guy
in
a
nice
car
would
show
up
.

short
time
later
the
guy
would
leave
,
then
the
girl
.

my
apartment
was
usually
quiet
.

i
lived
in
one
that
did
not
face
the
parking
lot
.

parking
spaces
are
just
big
enough
for
a
mini
cooper
.

it
sucked
having
an
suv
.

if
i
found
a
spot
,
i
could
nt
fit
in
it
.

gates
worked
30
%
of
the
time
at
best
.

bugs
were
a
small
problem
,
nothing
too
bad
.

the
best
there
is
in
service
.

i
was
recently
traveling
down
i
-
24
from
nashville
with
my
3
young
children
and
had
a
blowout
on
the
southeast
side
of
murfreesboro
.

it
was
4:50
when
a
friend
told
me
to
call
bud
,
he
would
take
care
of
me
.

not
only
did
they
answer
the
phone
at
4:50
on
a
thursday
,
they
hit
the
ground
moving
!.

they
tracked
down
the
only
tire
that
fit
my
bmw
330i
in
murfreesboro
within
minutes
and
secured
it
,
then
they
came
out
,
took
off
my
tire
(
it
was
a
runflat
-
but
runflats
do
n't
do
you
any
good
if
they
blow
out
)
,
and
brought
it
to
their
shop
to
change
the
tire
.

they
were
back
quickly
considering
how
far
outside
of
murfreesboro
we
were
and
had
us
on
our
way
by
6:30
that
evening
.

thanks
bud
for
all
of
your
help
and
taking
time
away
from
your
family
that
evening
.

it
's
without
a
doubt
,
the
best
service
experience
i
've
ever
had
and
just
to
be
clear
,
the
price
he
charged
me
was
the
same
as
my
tire
guy
in
nashville
's
price
for
putting
on
the
other
rear
tire
.

i
hope
i
can
return
the
favor
in
the
future
!

service
and
client
base
not
ok
.

i
have
stayed
in
this
hotel
many
times
,
and
while
it
typically
offers
a
decent
bang
for
the
buck
,
its
client
base
largely
consists
of
troubled
youngsteers
and
evictees
from
the
local
,
not
so
pleasant
hood
.

i
have
never
considered
this
a
real
problem
as
i
travel
without
kids
and
can
fend
for
myself
,
but
when
i
had
to
listen
to
a
(
non-violent
)
domestic
fight
that
lasted
from
1
am
to
5
am
during
my
last
stay
and
i
found
out
that
the
front
desk
was
unmanned
during
night
hours
,
my
choice
was
to
either
waste
tax
payers
money
by
calling
for
a
yet
another
police
dispatch
to
this
hotel
,
or
just
get
over
it
.

i
chose
the
later
,
but
approached
the
front
desk
about
the
hotel
policy
to
push
over
their
responsibilities
on
local
authorities
,
not
to
mention
the
good
night
s
sleep
i
paid
for
but
did
nt
get
.

i
was
told
management
would
call
me
back
but
still
waiting
for
that
call
.

i
will
probably
stay
here
again
because
it
s
cheap
and
i
ca
nt
afford
a
better
hotel
,
but
do
not
look
forward
to
it
and
would
definitely
not
recommend
this
hotel
for
families
or
single
female
travellers
.

was
there
this
past
weekend
and
the
guy
behind
the
counter
yelled
at
me
and
my
son
because
we
believed
he
left
the
grandma
slice
in
the
oven
a
little
too
long
and
the
cheese
got
all
dried
out
and
the
slice
tasted
more
like
a
cracker
.

he
preceded
to
grab
the
slice
off
the
countertop
and
throw
it
into
the
trash
while
yelling
at
me
saying
,
"
you
do
not
order
what
you
do
not
know
about
"
and
"
you
do
n't
know
how
pizza
is
made
"
.

it
was
very
upsetting
to
see
this
kind
of
behavior
especially
in
front
of
my
four
year
old
.

he
was
in
the
process
of
making
me
a
pie
and
when
i
got
home
,
the
pie
was
the
worst
i
have
ever
seen
.

cheese
was
falling
off
,
so
oily
and
greasy
.

i
think
he
did
it
on
purpose
because
of
my
simple
request
for
another
slice
of
grandma
that
was
n't
so
well
-
done
(
actually
,
burnt
)
.

i
will
never
go
back
to
this
place
and
i
am
reporting
them
to
the
better
business
bureau
for
such
horrible
customer
relations
and
basically
sabotaging
my
pizza
and
taking
my
$
25
.

this
story
is
100
%
true
.

that
little
man
who
thinks
he
invented
pizza
can
kiss
my
*ss
.

long
lines
,
silly
rules
,
rude
staff
,
ok
food

the
first
thing
you
notice
when
you
arrive
on
location
is
that
the
waiting
line
literally
goes
out
the
door
and
spills
into
the
parking
lot
.

a
restaurant
with
this
many
patrons
willing
to
stand
in
line
just
to
order
tacos
must
be
good
,
right
?

i
mean
,
that
's
the
way
it
works
at
amusement
parks
:
the
longest
lines
are
at
the
best
rides
.

well
,
this
may
be
an
exception
.

the
staff
taking
your
order
and
"
waiting
"
on
you
are
very
indifferent
and
have
no
sense
of
costumer
service
at
all
.

i
have
gotten
better
results
talking
to
comcast
customer
service
than
with
these
folks
.

and
do
n't
even
think
about
asking
to
speak
to
the
manager
because
this
guy
is
,
and
pardon
my
french
,
a
jerk
.

if
you
have
gotten
through
ordering
,
dealing
with
the
rude
staff
and
if
you
followed
the
dumb
rules
,
you
are
finally
presented
with
what
you
came
for
..
some
tacos
that
are
"
ok
,
"
but
definitely
not
worth
putting
up
with
all
the
hassle
.

save
yourself
the
trouble
and
skip
this
place
all
together
.

i
suggest
you
go
up
to
raging
taco
&
raging
burrito
a
couple
of
blocks
up
the
street
or
even
taco
mac
.

wish
this
was
in
saratoga
--

we
were
introduced
to
bistro
tallulah
by
traveler
-
professional
diner
who
happens
to
own
the
adelphi
hotel
and
travels
the
world
--
and
residing
in
paris
,
london
,
new
york
the
rest
of
the
year
.

she
knows
great
food
and
dining
experiences
.

she
was
dead
on
--
this
restaurant
was
wonderful
---
do
not
be
put
off
by
the
one
negative
review
on
this
page
.

i
can
tell
you
we
were
pleasantly
surprised
--
bt
has
taste
memory
and
each
time
back
the
food
was
consistently
delicious
--
same
dishes
--
were
consistent
.

our
friend
is
a
world
traveler
and
loves
unpretentious
dining
experiences
and
inspired
food
.

this
chef
knows
what
he
is
doing
.

treat
yourself
and
go
--
you
will
go
back
!

i
am
a
business
owner
in
downtown
saratoga
springs
and
wish
this
restaurant
was
in
our
town
!

the
affordable
rent
makes
it
possible
for
an
inspired
chef
to
serve
his
high
quality
fare
at
affordable
prices
!

unlike
saratoga
.

i
rrly
seek
the
cehf
out
to
introduce
myself
--
but
the
second
time
we
went
--
i
made
a
point
of
asking
our
wait
person
to
introduce
my
friend
and
myself
to
the
chef
to
tell
him
just
how
good
our
meals
were
.

can
not
wait
to
go
gain
.

morris
.

i
think
that
the
re
pretty
good
.

first
of
all
,
if
you
call
for
an
appointment
they
wo
n't
tell
you
to
call
back
a
month
later
so
you
can
then
make
one
.

they
also
do
n't
tell
you
that
they
're
going
to
mail
you
an
"
application
"
to
be
admitted
to
be
a
patient
.

i
feel
that
the
way
some
doctor
s
offices
work
around
here
is
a
little
bit
absurd
so
i
'm
happy
that
these
guys
do
n't
do
those
two
things
in
particlular
.

usually
you
can
be
seen
the
same
week
or
maybe
the
following
week
.

the
doctor
did
tell
me
that
my
male
pattern
baldness
is
due
to
my
mother
s
father
because
the
gene
is
exclusively
passed
on
through
maternal
line
but
that
's
a
common
misconception
(
http://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-living/beauty-personal-care/hair-loss-10-08/hair-loss.htm
)
.

in
general
i
would
say
that
the
staff
is
attentive
and
nice
.

but
then
again
i
was
nice
to
them
so
that
could
have
been
why
.

anyhow
,
after
reading
some
of
the
other
reviews
it
seems
like
some
of
the
other
reviewers
are
expecting
mircles
.

if
you
want
miracles
you
'll
have
to
go
to
21st
st
.

it
's
a
pretty
typical
primary
care
office
but
for
the
area
it
's
very
good
.

they
do
n't
do
certain
things
that
are
really
annoying
about
other
offices
.

first
trip
to
canada

i
recently
traveled
to
canada
on
business
and
had
a
most
excellent
experience
.

i
work
for
a
large
retail
company
recently
expanding
our
operations
into
canada
and
had
to
travel
to
ensure
all
of
our
computer
network
equipment
was
installed
properly
and
on
time
.

this
can
tend
to
be
a
stressful
experience
in
itself
let
alone
adding
crossing
boarders
for
the
first
time
.

i
was
very
pleased
to
find
my
accommodations
and
the
hotel
staff
to
be
a
very
calming
and
comforting
part
of
my
trip
.

i
found
the
hotel
to
be
amazingly
clean
,
not
to
mention
very
well
adorned
with
many
pleasant
surprises
.

from
my
first
encounter
at
check
in
to
my
regrettable
check
out
i
found
the
staff
and
facility
to
exceed
my
expectation
.

i
completely
enjoyed
my
whole
check
in
experience
and
was
impressed
with
the
friendliness
and
professionalism
of
the
staff
as
well
as
the
accommodations
themselves
.

i
will
be
traveling
in
this
area
in
the
future
and
you
can
be
assured
that
this
experience
will
be
helpful
in
my
choice
of
hotels
and
novotel
will
be
my
first
selection
.

yes
the
parking
can
be
a
challenge
but
being
from
nj
i
am
no
stranger
to
tight
corners
.

please
pass
my
appreciation
to
the
staff
and
management
for
their
excellent
hospitality
and
good
spirits
as
it
helped
make
a
stressful
trip
enjoyable
.

favorite
place
in
tampa
.

update
:
i
had
to
add
to
my
review
.

i
was
just
in
last
night
and
had
a
chance
to
dine
in
their
new
dining
room
.

amazing
!

i
frequent
this
resturant
on
a
weekly
basis
but
usally
only
for
lunch
.

well
i
was
in
for
a
treat
when
i
was
greeted
by
the
friendly
girls
at
the
counter
who
asked
if
my
wife
and
i
would
like
to
sit
in
their
"
new
"
dining
room
.

right
away
they
told
us
that
it
was
the
same
great
food
with
the
same
prices
so
off
we
went
.

we
were
greeted
again
and
sat
promptly
.

after
looking
at
the
menu
and
seeing
the
new
menu
items
they
had
,
we
knew
we
were
in
for
a
treat
!

i
had
the
chicken
parmesan
dinner
and
my
wife
had
the
shrimp
scampi
dinner
.

amazing
!

the
portions
were
generous
enough
that
we
even
took
some
home
!

i
have
to
say
the
value
of
this
place
always
amazes
me
.

it
's
nice
to
see
that
even
in
the
economy
we
can
eat
a
place
that
has
upscale
service
,
amazing
atmosphere
,
and
incredible
food
,
but
not
break
the
bank
while
enjoying
it
!

bottom
line
is
that
when
it
's
a
small
privatly
owned
resturant
like
this
is
you
can
tell
that
the
owners
and
employees
take
pride
in
their
product
and
service
.

well
done
!

great
work
and
honest
establishment
!

i
typically
have
work
done
on
my
jeep
at
the
dealership
,
but
it
is
6
years
old
now
and
getting
charged
dealership
prices
just
did
n't
seem
cost
effective
anymore
.

i
had
tried
out
few
place
around
the
area
and
had
been
ripped
off
a
few
times
.

i
had
hear
great
things
about
phet
and
g&g
automotive
so
i
decided
to
give
him
a
try
.

the
service
was
excellent
and
personable
.

he
checked
out
what
i
needed
to
have
done
told
me
what
needed
be
fixed
before
he
did
any
work
and
did
great
repair
work
.

the
price
was
actually
lower
than
what
i
had
anticipated
and
used
to
compared
to
other
places
,
plus
he
showed
me
the
work
he
did
when
i
came
in
to
pick
up
the
car
.

also
,
a
week
after
the
work
,
phet
called
me
up
to
see
how
my
car
was
running
and
to
let
me
know
that
they
had
accidentally
overcharged
me
for
part
of
the
work
and
wanted
to
give
me
a
refund
for
that
amount
.

that
is
just
unheard
of
these
days
!

i
grew
up
in
a
small
town
where
you
knew
and
trusted
your
mechanic
and
was
really
cynical
about
city
auto
repair
shops
since
i
moved
here
,
but
phet
has
shown
that
there
really
are
honest
hard
working
mechanics
around
.

he
is
my
mechanic
going
forward
!

our
company
is
a
high
end
designer
handbag
and
fashion
accessories
company
,
thus
we
are
certainly
a
niche
market
.

we
had
been
evaluating
seo
providers
for
quite
some
time
and
finally
decided
to
take
the
plunge
with
stuart
,
and
ulistic
.

we
made
the
decision
for
a
couple
of
reasons
.

1
.
social
media
.

we
were
familiar
with
search
engine
optimization
strategies
,
but
new
nothing
about
social
media
-
we
just
heard
that
it
was
the
next
big
thing
.

2
.
we
really
liked
the
fact
that
stuart
sets
defined
objectives
and
we
meet
once
a
month
to
go
over
our
key
performance
indicators
.

how
has
it
gone
so
far
?

well
we
have
been
working
with
ulistic
for
1.5
months
,
and
have
100
people
following
our
site
on
facebook
,
and
our
web
site
,
www.designofashion.com
has
seen
a
3
fold
increase
in
traffic
,
which
is
significantly
beating
our
expectations
-
seo
is
a
process
that
takes
time
and
to
get
results
this
quickly
is
exceptional
.

we
are
absolutely
confident
that
stuart
's
ethical
and
focused
strategies
will
see
these
trends
continue
to
grow
,
and
our
business
will
reap
the
rewards
of
this
program
.

finally
,
it
must
be
said
that
stuart
is
a
fantastic
person
to
work
with
,
because
of
his
solid
strategies
and
equally
as
importantly
because
he
is
a
genuinely
good
person
and
a
great
communicator
.

excellent
service
and
quality

i
had
hom
-
excel
replace
most
of
the
windows
in
my
tampa
residence
three
years
ago
.

the
excellent
windows
have
performed
without
any
problems
,
but
that
's
not
why
i
'm
writing
my
review
.

three
weeks
ago
,
burglars
tried
to
gain
entry
into
the
rear
of
my
home
.

the
intruders
slit
the
screen
of
the
window
.

next
,
they
tried
to
force
the
window
with
a
pry
bar
and
then
to
break
the
window
with
a
hammer
.

the
window
did
n't
break
!

my
next
-
door
neighbor
heard
the
noise
and
turned
on
a
light
,
thankfully
scaring
the
two
miscreants
away
(
they
even
left
their
hammer
behind
!
)
.

i
called
home
-
excel
the
next
day
to
order
a
replacement
screen
for
the
window
,
and
was
happily
surprised
when
they
said
that
they
were
n't
even
going
to
charge
me
for
the
replacement
screen
...
that
it
would
be
covered
under
their
guarentee
.

lo
and
behold
,
they
replaced
the
screen
(
which
had
to
be
ordered
)
yesterday
and
did
n't
charge
me
a
dime
.

their
worker
even
cleaned
3
of
my
windows
and
changed
a
lightbulb
for
me
.

in
this
day
and
age
,
it
is
so
rare
to
find
a
company
with
such
nice
workers
and
such
far
ranging
guarantee
policies
.

i
rarely
write
reviews
such
as
this
one
,
but
they
certainly
deserve
anyone
's
business
!

friendly
staff
,
but
definitely
some
problems

may
,
2009
.

we
were
booked
at
the
sheraton
with
a
number
of
other
out
-
of
-
town
wedding
guests
.

got
put
into
the
wrong
room
the
first
night
,
and
were
quite
surprised
to
have
someone
with
the
same
room
key
trying
to
get
in
the
door
at
1:00
am
!

next
day
got
moved
into
another
room
,
on
the
same
floor
with
other
wedding
guests
.

there
were
3
adults
in
our
room
but
towels
for
only
2
,
no
linens
for
sofa
bed
.

in
the
second
room
it
took
3
tries
to
get
all
the
towels
and
linens
we
requested
.

a
package
and
some
wedding
cards
were
left
in
our
first
room
.

they
were
sent
to
our
second
room
and
had
been
opened
--
the
ribbon
-
wrapped
present
,
and
all
3
envelopes
.

security
in
the
hotel
seemed
to
be
excellent
,
but
we
were
never
given
an
explanation
as
to
why
someone
would
open
these
items
.

a
mid-afternoon
"
fire
drill
"
was
disruptive
,
putting
everyone
out
of
the
hotel
.

when
we
called
the
front
desk
about
an
extremely
boisterous
crowd
in
the
hall
outside
our
door
quite
late
at
night
,
it
seemed
to
take
the
hotel
staff
quite
a
while
to
quiet
them
down
.

the
staff
was
friendly
,
especially
the
front
desk
female
supervisor
,
and
seemed
to
want
to
help
,
but
too
many
unusual
things
happened
to
make
us
want
to
stay
there
again
.

be
careful
of
who
your
sales
guy
is

i
think
this
place
is
probably
really
great
especially
judging
by
the
reviews
on
here
.

my
experience
was
awful
though
.

it
all
had
to
do
with
the
sales
guy
which
was
a
young
22
year
old
who
had
admittedly
only
been
working
for
2
weeks
.

i
was
extremely
interested
in
the
car
and
very
likely
would
have
bought
it
,
but
the
sales
guy
i
dealt
with
ruined
the
deal
.

essentially
,
i
told
him
i
did
n't
trust
him
cause
he
was
a
car
salesman
,
but
he
got
so
incredibly
offended
at
that
statement
that
he
had
to
go
cry
to
another
salesman
and
compose
himself
before
coming
back
.

i
do
n't
know
if
the
kid
had
a
bad
day
or
what
,
but
i
had
to
sit
and
apologize
about
nothing
for
10
minutes
until
he
dropped
the
issue
.

after
that
,
i
just
tried
to
ignore
his
lack
of
professionalism
and
test
drive
the
car
.

i
played
dumb
and
asked
him
questions
that
i
already
knew
the
answers
to
and
he
responded
with
half
truths
and
a
few
falsehoods
.

for
instance
i
asked
who
owned
mazda
and
he
said
with
confidence
that
was
gm
,
which
is
n't
true
.

i
mean
,
i
do
n't
care
if
he
does
n't
know
,
but
if
he
pretends
to
know
and
tells
me
bs
to
my
face
,
there
's
no
way
i
'm
going
to
trust
him
when
matters
turn
to
the
price
of
the
car
and
financing
.

the
worst
chinese
i
've
ever
had

this
is
by
far
the
worst
chinese
food
i
have
ever
had
.

the
service
stunk
.

i
called
in
my
order
and
upon
arriving
to
pick
it
up
,
they
got
my
order
confused
with
someone
else
s
.

they
helped
about
three
other
people
before
they
offered
to
help
me
again
.

they
also
got
my
friend
s
order
mixed
up
and
wanted
to
charger
her
$
10
more
than
what
she
had
wanted
.

she
asked
for
the
dinner
combo
and
they
gave
her
two
dinner
plates
instead
.

we
were
standing
in
the
store
for
20
minutes
to
simply
pick
up
an
order
.

not
to
mention
that
the
wait
staff
was
about
as
pleasant
as
dealing
with
an
angry
bull
.

they
were
abrasive
and
rude
-
when
they
were
the
ones
who
messed
everything
up
.

we
had
to
throw
out
about
80
percent
of
our
meals
because
the
food
tasted
so
horrible
.

i
do
nt
know
how
it
is
possible
to
make
orange
chicken
,
sesame
chicken
and
kung
pao
chicken
as
well
as
cheese
puffs
taste
that
bad
but
china
delight
accomplished
that
.

the
only
thing
that
was
edible
was
the
steamed
rice
and
the
vegetable
lo
mein
was
barely
tolerable
.

i
will
never
go
here
again
.

lucky
panda
in
willis
is
a
billion
times
better
in
service
and
quality
of
the
meal
.

i
have
no
idea
how
china
delight
won
number
1
chinese
restaurant
in
montgomery
-
there
needs
to
be
a
recount
on
that
vote
.

terrible
service

one
of
the
worst
experiences
i
've
ever
had
with
a
auto
repair
shop
.

we
took
our
vehicle
in
for
a
repair
to
the
air
conditioning
.

approx
4
months
later
,
the
compressor
went
out
.

we
took
it
back
in
to
have
it
repaired
again
,
and
less
than
a
week
later
the
second
compressor
went
out
.

we
went
in
for
a
third
visit
and
they
fixed
it
again
,
but
this
time
when
we
picked
up
the
car
,
the
radio
and
clock
did
not
work
.

so
for
the
4th
time
in
5
months
and
the
third
time
in
2
weeks
,
we
brought
the
car
back
again
.

when
we
expressed
our
discontent
to
the
manager
(
that
's
right
,
the
manager
)
,
did
he
say
he
would
return
some
money
,
did
he
say
he
would
give
a
discount
on
our
next
visit
,
did
he
just
say
"
i
'm
sorry
"
.

nope
,
none
of
the
above
.

he
stood
there
and
told
us
how
he
was
n't
at
fault
.

it
was
the
fault
of
the
parts
supplier
,
and
can
we
imagine
how
he
felt
having
to
put
another
2
hours
of
work
in
the
car
.

and
what
did
we
expect
...
that
he
bench
test
every
part
.

at
no
time
during
the
conversation
did
the
words
,
"
i
'm
sorry
"
ever
come
out
of
his
mouth
.

i
,
nor
anyone
else
in
my
family
,
will
ever
go
to
sun
devil
auto
again
.

well
,
unless
of
course
the
third
compressor
he
put
in
the
car
goes
out
.

do
not
use
this
company
!

i
dropped
off
a
sheet
metal
piece
that
i
needed
copied
due
to
th
it
was
needing
to
be
replaced
.

i
asked
if
they
could
copy
the
piece
i
dropped
off
.

they
said
it
would
be
made
exactly
like
the
one
i
needed
to
replace
.

i
picked
it
up
when
it
was
finished
and
was
charge
30.00
.

when
i
got
to
the
job
and
tried
to
insert
the
new
piece
of
metal
it
would
not
fit
!!

i
took
the
original
piece
of
metal
and
rigged
it
to
make
due
since
i
had
to
complete
the
job
.

i
took
the
receipt
and
the
metal
that
did
not
fit
and
asked
pomper
for
my
money
back
.

the
girl
at
the
desk
was
sooo
rude
i
could
not
believe
it
!

she
told
me
she
could
not
use
the
piece
i
was
returning
and
the
company
would
only
put
it
in
the
trash
so
i
could
not
return
it
.

i
explained
i
did
not
get
what
i
paid
for
.

she
asked
me
to
bring
the
original
piece
back
and
i
told
her
i
had
to
use
it
on
the
job
.

she
told
me
that
was
to
bad
she
would
do
nothing
to
help
me
since
she
could
not
use
or
resell
the
piece
.

i
said
i
was
going
to
trash
it
also
and
could
i
at
least
have
a
credit
.

with
a
smirk
on
her
face
she
told
me
no
money
is
being
returned
and
that
is
the
way
it
was
.

do
not
use
this
company
.

there
are
to
many
people
that
need
our
business
to
have
to
put
up
with
this
unfair
treatment
!!!!!

i
would
never
recommend
this
gym
to
anyone
and
unfortunately
this
is
based
solely
on
the
owner
's
own
unprofessionalism
.

when
i
originally
joined
in
january
i
only
did
so
because
i
was
told
i
would
be
able
to
cancel
the
12
month
membership
if
i
was
to
move
away
.

i
signed
up
with
one
of
the
staff
who
was
very
pleasant
and
professional
.

actually
working
out
there
was
good
-
the
machines
are
nice
and
the
classes
are
fun
.

the
locker
room
is
certainly
lacking
-
i
would
never
shower
or
change
there
.

they
need
to
update
the
locker
rooms
asap
.

back
to
my
poor
rating
-
i
was
excepted
to
medical
school
and
went
in
to
cancel
my
membership
as
i
was
told
i
could
do
since
i
was
moving
away
.

the
owner
was
very
rude
,
accused
me
of
not
reading
my
contract
,
and
basically
told
me
to
shut
up
when
i
was
trying
to
ask
questions
to
further
understand
the
process
of
canceling
my
membership
.

i
was
able
to
cancel
it
but
only
after
paying
a
$
50
fee
(
which
the
staff
person
who
signed
me
up
stated
i
would
not
have
to
pay
if
i
had
proof
of
moving
)
and
being
spoken
to
in
a
very
belittling
manner
.

i
would
understand
if
i
was
being
treated
this
way
by
a
staff
member
but
the
club
's
actual
owner
?!

bad
for
business
.

i
was
appalled
.

i
will
never
recommend
this
gym
to
any
woman
.

the
equipment
and
classes
are
n't
good
enough
to
deal
with
the
rudeness
from
the
staff
!!!

there
are
better
places
on
the
cape

the
salon
experience
from
hell

i
feel
obligated
to
share
this
story
.

right
out
of
college
i
called
the
salon
and
explained
my
situation
.

just
graduated
,
just
moved
,
not
rich
,
and
starting
new
job
soon
.

i
never
got
a
price
quote
over
the
phone
and
they
take
your
cc
info
just
to
make
the
appointment
because
if
you
do
n't
show
up
,
they
'll
charge
you
.

i
had
this
ridiculous
celebrity
stylist
from
la
named
derrick
.

after
he
already
put
product
on
my
hair
he
said
"
i
should
warn
you
,
i
'm
expensive
.
"

what
was
i
supposed
to
do
,
say
i
ca
n't
afford
you
and
walk
out
with
crap
all
over
my
hair
.

i
wanted
to
be
very
blonde
and
instead
he
pulled
my
root
color
throughout
my
whole
hair
which
is
a
gross
mousey
brown
.

the
other
stylists
around
me
kept
pressuring
me
saying
he
's
so
wonderful
,
you
're
going
to
love
your
hair
.

$
400
later
my
jaw
dropped
when
the
receptionist
told
me
the
total
.

derrick
did
a
terrible
job
,
was
a
complete
jerk
the
entire
time
,
and
i
had
no
warning
as
to
the
price
.

i
cried
the
entire
way
home
.

he
then
"
fixed
"
it
for
free
but
it
still
looked
like
crap
.

i
will
never
go
back
.

it
was
the
salon
experience
from
absolutely
hell
.

he
also
told
me
that
he
worked
on
the
cast
of
will
and
grace
and
that
they
were
all
jerks
.

that
's
my
favorite
show
of
all
time
.

i
'm
pretty
sure
for
the
cast
that
it
was
the
other
way
around
.

maybe
he
did
n't
do
a
good
job
and
they
told
him
so
.

absolute
nightmare
!

stay
away
!

very
unhappy
...

working
with
rod
jacobsen
was
my
first
experience
working
with
a
cpa
,
so
i
did
not
know
what
to
expect
.

that
said
-
he
seemed
to
be
doing
well
enough
.

however
,
then
i
asked
to
amend
my
return
to
apply
a
credit
i
had
just
become
eligible
for
.

i
expected
to
pay
for
this
service
,
but
imagine
my
surprise
when
i
received
a
bill
for
more
than
what
i
paid
to
have
the
original
return
prepared
.

asked
why
,
rod
simply
told
me
that
he
had
to
research
how
to
do
the
amendment
(
it
was
an
amended
to
show
that
i
had
purchased
a
home
-
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
,
one
would
think
)
and
that
took
time
to
figure
out
.

well
,
that
was
strike
one
.

i
was
n't
going
to
use
them
again
,
but
i
was
going
to
leave
it
at
that
.

however
,
now
that
i
have
come
to
realize
that
i
am
going
to
owe
the
irs
$
6,000
+
despite
doing
exactly
what
rod
told
me
to
do
,
i
feel
i
have
to
voice
my
opinion
.

last
year
,
after
all
was
said
and
done
,
i
asked
rod
whether
my
payment
structure
would
leave
me
with
no
/
little
tax
liability
at
the
end
of
the
year
.

he
said
yes
.

well
,
again
,
i
am
now
faced
with
a
tax
bill
of
$
6,000
+
,
all
due
on
april
15
,
2010
and
all
that
rod
has
to
say
to
the
matter
is
'
well
,
you
wo
n't
have
to
pay
a
penalty
.
'

i
may
not
have
to
pay
a
penalty
,
yet
,
but
this
is
not
what
i
had
in
mind
when
hired
these
guys
.

in
the
words
of
my
new
accountant
,
they
let
me
down
!

bit
sketchy
,
sporadic
delivery
times

i
bought
about
half
of
the
furniture
i
own
from
this
place
.

why
?

because
they
cut
me
good
deals
if
i
paid
in
cash
.

sketchy
,
right
?

well
they
came
through
and
delivered
almost
all
of
my
items
within
a
few
days
.

(
they
even
got
me
a
couch
pretty
quickly
.
)

the
guy
who
was
cutting
me
the
deals
and
getting
me
the
furniture
quickly
,
ahmed
,
was
nice
and
mostly
professional
,
except
the
semi-sketchiness
.

then
one
day
,
ahmed
left
the
country
,
not
to
return
for
months
,
without
informing
me
.

he
also
neglected
to
tell
the
other
person
working
at
the
store
about
a
dining
room
table
that
i
had
ordered
and
that
was
supposed
to
be
coming
in
.

the
other
person
working
at
the
store
did
n't
know
that
i
still
had
this
table
coming
.

i
had
paid
in
cash
,
and
he
said
he
had
no
receipt
/
record
of
my
purchase
.

i
came
back
with
the
receipt
ahmed
had
provided
upon
my
purchase
,
and
the
guy
took
forever
to
copy
it
but
said
that
he
would
take
care
of
the
situation
.

i
waited
.

and
waited
.

he
never
once
contacted
us
.

i
've
had
to
pester
this
new
guy
several
times
to
ask
when
my
table
will
arrive
.

he
kept
saying
different
arrival
/
delivery
dates
and
did
n't
seem
terribly
apologetic
.

it
has
been
3
weeks
and
i
still
do
n't
have
my
table
(
which
was
not
cheap
,
i
might
add
)
.

point
is
:
you
might
be
able
to
get
a
good
deal
on
some
nice
furniture
--
which
i
did
--
but
they
're
not
very
communicative
and
god
forbid
something
goes
wrong
,
you
'll
have
to
fight
to
get
it
resolved
.

poor
service

run
do
n't
walk
.

my
experience
with
home
delivery
service
has
been
one
of
disappointment
and
anger
.

if
i
could
give
them
a
lower
rating
than
poor
i
would
.

on
august
21st
,
2009
i
ordered
furniture
from
hickory
furniture
mart
and
contracted
for
hds
to
deliver
it
.

after
seventeen
days
the
delivery
van
showed
up
at
my
home
minus
two
pieces
.

i
was
later
told
they
had
been
left
at
the
warehouse
and
some
future
date
they
would
be
delivered
.

no
one
will
give
me
a
date
.

i
spent
$
2300
on
the
bedroom
suite
,
which
was
complete
and
excellent
condition
on
the
showroom
floor
.

upon
delivery
it
was
clear
the
entire
set
was
damaged
:
a
piece
of
wood
was
broke
on
the
headboard
;
the
chest
of
drawers
was
missing
all
four
pieces
necessary
to
attach
the
legs
;
the
dresser
back
legs
were
pushed
in
causing
the
dresser
to
lean
into
the
wall
;
and
a
nighstand
was
missing
a
drawer
.

how
do
you
lose
a
drawer
.

after
complaining
on
september
10th
to
national
home
furnishings
,
boyles
,
the
hickory
furniture
mart
and
home
delivery
service
the
latter
finally
called
me
back
and
said
they
would
be
up
to
pick
the
dresser
and
chest
of
drawers
at
some
future
point
and
at
some
later
point
it
would
be
professional
repaired
and
at
some
later
point
it
would
be
returned
.

the
customer
service
at
home
delivery
service
was
terrible
let
alone
their
promise
to
proper
set
up
furniture
.

so
i
am
in
limbo
regarding
a
bedroom
suite
.

i
hope
the
owners
and
employees
of
this
store
have
broken
bedroom
suites
in
their
homes
and
furniture
sitting
in
someone
's
warehouse
.

maybe
then
they
will
begin
to
understand
poor
customer
service
and
terrible
sit
up
service
.

excellent
driving
school

i
was
involved
in
a
car
accident
20
years
ago
and
since
then
i
've
been
a
nervous
wreck
and
have
n't
been
behind
the
wheel
.

unfortunately
,
a
family
emergency
required
me
to
conquer
this
fear
.

a
very
good
friend
of
mine
highly
recommended
the
professional
driving
school
and
i
was
told
to
specifically
ask
for
gerry
.

she
highly
recommended
him
and
described
him
as
the
"
saintly
instructor
and
simply
the
best
instructor
there
is
....
very
calm
,
pleasant
and
very
detailed
in
giving
instructions
"
.

i
called
the
school
most
probably
10
times
before
i
finally
enrolled
in
a
20
hour
package
.

i
had
to
cancel
my
initial
lesson
4
times
and
on
the
5th
attempt
the
management
was
quick
enough
to
associate
my
cancellations
with
my
fear
and
finally
encouraged
me
into
taking
my
initial
lesson
.

five
minutes
before
my
initial
lesson
,
i
got
a
call
from
gerry
advising
me
of
his
arrival
and
to
come
down
as
soon
as
i
was
ready
.

my
heart
pounded
as
i
walked
down
and
pounded
even
faster
upon
seeing
gerry
in
an
suv
-
lexus
!

i
thought
of
canceling
the
lesson
once
again
because
i
did
n't
feel
comfortable
driving
an
suv
.

gerry
pleasantly
said
"
since
i
am
already
here
why
do
n't
we
give
it
shot
.

i
trust
you
and
believe
that
you
'll
be
able
to
handle
this
and
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
reciprocate
!

trust
me
and
most
especially
trust
and
believe
in
yourself
.

do
n't
worry
,
i
'll
take
care
of
you
!
"

.......
the
rest
was
history
!

here
i
am
now
driving
confidently
on
my
own
.

gerry
,
i
ca
n't
thank
you
enough
for
helping
me
cope
with
my
fear
.

to
my
friend
,
thank
you
for
your
recommendation
...
you
were
true
to
your
words
in
saying
gerry
is
a
"
saintly
instructor
...
absolutely
simple
the
best
instructor
and
best
driving
school
there
is
!

review
on
house
of
joy
chinese
restaurant

my
family
and
i
moved
to
san
antonio
a
year
ago
and
have
tried
almost
all
of
the
chinese
restaurants
because
we
love
chinese
food
.

well
it
took
us
a
while
to
find
one
that
we
liked
.

but
we
do
n't
just
like
house
of
joy
we
love
it
.

everything
we
have
gotten
there
has
been
more
authentic
and
better
tasting
than
any
other
chinese
restaurant
in
the
san
antonio
area
we
have
been
to
--
and
trust
me
we
have
been
to
a
lot
of
them
.

we
just
happen
to
stumble
across
this
little
restaurant
one
day
when
we
had
to
visit
the
bexar
county
tax
office
off
of
bandera
road
.

we
stopped
in
and
got
some
take
out
and
can
not
stop
going
back
.

they
have
the
best
egg
drop
soup
i
have
ever
tasted
.

we
also
love
their
egg
rolls
and
spring
rolls
.

and
every
entree
we
have
ordered
is
perfect
.

everything
is
always
cooked
fresh
and
tastes
fresh
.

their
prices
are
extremely
reasonable
for
the
amount
of
food
you
receive
.

the
staff
is
also
just
so
pleasant
to
deal
with
.

they
are
also
quick
at
getting
your
order
out
to
you
.

you
do
n't
have
to
sit
and
wait
around
forever
like
most
places
!!

so
anyone
looking
for
an
excellent
night
out
for
chinese
or
maybe
just
lunch
should
stop
in
and
try
it
because
i
promise
you
2
things
---
you
wo
n't
regret
it
!!

and
you
will
go
back
for
more
!!!

karla
ferguson
-
granger

ps
i
have
noticed
on
here
that
someone
left
a
comment
that
"
all
of
the
nice
comments
must
come
from
co
workers
or
friends
"
and
i
will
tell
you
that
i
do
n't
know
these
people
except
from
eating
at
their
restaurant
.

we
are
from
virginia
and
just
moved
here
a
year
ago
.

so
that
comment
is
completely
false
.

because
we
think
it
's
the
best
!!!

and
we
do
n't
know
them
except
for
eating
there
.

dr.
strzalka
at
flagship
cvts
is
not
a
good
doctor

i
am
not
sure
about
the
quality
of
the
other
doctors
there
,
but
i
do
know
from
personal
experience
that
dr.
christopher
t.
strzalka
is
not
a
man
of
his
word
,
and
is
also
very
cruel
and
uncaring
!!

he
was
going
to
operate
and
replace
my
bicuspid
aortic
valve
due
to
critical
aortic
stenosis
.

i
had
a
surgery
date
of
july
17
,
2008
.

then
he
renigged
when
he
read
my
health
care
proxy
,
even
though
i
agreed
to
be
on
the
ventilator
for
2
months
following
surgery
(
as
he
had
twice
stated
i
must
agree
to
)
.

he
later
said
that
by
2
months
he
"
meant
at
least
two
months
"
.

two
months
and
at
least
two
months
are
totally
different
things
.

he
did
not
even
give
me
the
chance
to
say
i
would
stay
on
the
ventilator
longer
,
which
i
would
have
.

a
health
care
proxy
is
not
written
in
stone
and
can
be
changed
.

he
also
never
even
said
he
was
sorry
.

just
said
i
was
inoperable
and
walked
out
of
the
hospital
room
.

so
,
therefore
,
now
he
says
i
am
inoperable
(
even
though
i
am
not
100
%
inoperable
)
,
and
he
is
letting
me
die
.

i
am
just
middle
aged
and
do
not
want
to
die
,
but
thanks
to
this
doctor
i
have
no
other
alternatives
.

i
,
along
with
my
friends
,
consider
this
doctor
to
be
the
cause
of
my
death
as
he
is
not
even
trying
to
save
my
life
by
operating
.

even
my
pa
i
went
to
the
other
day
said
"
it
must
by
comforting
to
have
gone
to
a
heart
surgeon
like
him
who
will
do
nothing
for
you
"
.

he
said
it
sarcastically
.

if
you
want
a
doctor
who
will
lie
to
you
and
say
he
will
operate
and
then
change
his
mind
,
and
not
know
what
he
is
talking
about
when
he
recommends
procedures
at
other
hospitals
and
says
they
are
what
you
need
,
when
they
will
not
work
for
you
,
go
to
this
doctor
...
he
is
the
one
for
you
.

what
you
can
learn
from
the
below
'
bad
experience
'
.

i
would
suggest
not
avoiding
second
home
based
on
the
'
bad
experience
'
review
.

i
'd
probably
be
more
inclined
to
board
my
two
dogs
here
,
seeing
that
they
do
n't
just
take
every
dog
coming
in
.

i
've
toured
this
place
and
was
impressed
by
how
clean
the
place
was
,
and
all
the
options
for
the
dogs
.

it
's
unfortunate
that
bmil
believed
that
his
'
perfect
'
dog
was
not
given
the
right
opportunity
to
prove
himself
.

but
i
've
done
hundreds
of
dog
introductions
myself
(
another
place
,
i
do
n't
work
here
)
,
and
owners
can
have
unrealistic
expectations
and
views
of
what
they
see
when
their
dogs
meet
other
dogs
.

workers
who
do
these
introductions
look
at
the
interaction
objectively
;
and
it
's
good
to
see
they
are
able
and
willing
to
say
no
if
they
feel
there
would
be
a
problem
.

it
sounds
(
according
to
your
own
statement
)
that
they
had
a
roomful
of
dogs
,
so
they
must
be
doing
something
right
-
and
are
keeping
those
dogs
safe
from
potential
problems
.

you
say
you
work
a
lot
,
and
that
you
have
a
young
dog
;
so
i
have
little
doubt
that
your
dog
is
just
filled
with
energy
to
burn
;
and
it
is
good
of
you
to
look
for
a
place
to
take
him
.

but
not
at
a
risk
to
other
people
's
pets
.

you
were
clearly
given
another
alternative
by
second
home
,
to
board
him
-
which
might
have
given
your
dog
a
chance
to
come
and
go
from
second
home
a
couple
times
,
getting
used
to
the
place
and
maybe
facilitating
another
attempt
to
get
into
daycare
later
.

no
business
is
going
to
push
customers
away
without
good
reason
;
so
is
n't
it
reasonable
to
think
they
might
know
what
they
're
doing
?

my
dogs
are
far
from
perfect
,
and
one
of
them
i
believe
would
be
a
little
much
for
daycare
here
herself
(
at
least
initially
)
.

be
a
little
more
reasonable
with
your
expectations
of
a
place
like
this
;
and
maybe
do
n't
jump
to
personal
attacks
suggesting
that
they
do
n't
want
to
work
hard
,
just
because
you
bruised
your
own
ego
.

dumbest
f'ers
ever

i
called
dominos
tonight
,
it
rang
forever
,
i
get
put
on
hold
twice
without

)

they
say
no

i
laugh
and
say

he
says
:

i
have

he
says
:

he
gives
the
phone
to
a
girl
,
she
says

she
says
,

17th
like

yes

i
say
,

14th
street
and
i
am
3
blocks
west
of
broad
and
one
south
of
walnut
.

hmmm
,
she
says
,
then
why
are
you
calling
here
,
we
do
n't
go
past
broad
?

anyway
,
after
much
yelling
and
cussing
i
hung
up
,
grabbed
a
cab
,
and
went
to
geno
's
.

quick
to
take
money
but
not
quick
to
fix
a
problem
!

b&b
came
out
very
quickly
to
give
us
our
quote
back
in
june
.

they
were
very
polite
,
eager
to
answer
any
questions
and
willing
to
wait
for
us
to
return
from
vacation
to
begin
installing
our
fence
.

our
fence
was
installed
quickly
in
august
and
they
had
their
money
and
left
saying
"
workmanship
is
guaranteed
for
a
year
!
"
.

within
a
week
we
noticed
one
of
the
boards
on
our
gate
splitting
where
a
nail
had
gone
in
.

we
called
our
representative
who
assured
me
he
would
call
the
office
and
have
it
taken
care
of
.

we
heard
nothing
.

we
then
called
the
office
and
the
man
we
spoke
to
said
he
'd
send
someone
out
to
look
at
it
but
could
n't
promise
when
-
two
weeks
came
and
went
and
we
heard
nothing
.

i
just
called
again
and
was
told
that
workmanship
,
not
wood
,
is
guaranteed
for
a
year
-
well
in
my
opinion
-
the
wood
split
due
to
a
nail
which
is
part
of
workmanship
!

she
even
went
so
far
as
to
say
"
you
r
calling
about
one
board
?
"

well
-
when
you
pay
over
$
1000
for
something
you
want
it
to
hold
up
and
look
good
!!!

yes
!

i
was
calling
about
one
board
!!

i
'm
very
frustrated
at
this
point
-
it
would
take
all
of
10
min
for
them
to
come
by
and
replace
the
one
board
that
is
cracked
(
the
crack
is
deep
enough
to
stick
a
penny
in
it
and
it
goes
clear
through
)
yet
they
do
not
want
to
take
the
time
to
bother
with
what
once
was
a
happy
customer
and
has
now
become
a
dissatisfied
customer
.

so
i
figure
if
they
do
n't
want
to
take
the
time
to
fix
the
fence
that
they
installed
then
i
'll
take
the
time
to
let
everyone
i
can
know
about
how
they
treat
customers
once
they
have
your
money
!!!

stay
away
!!!

you
get
what
you
pay
for
!!!

they
came
in
under
a
lot
of
other
quotes
and
now
i
know
why
!!!

when
the
fence
was
first
installed
i
would
have
given
them
five
stars
,
now
for
their
poor
customer
follow
-
up
and
unwillingness
to
fix
the
fence
they
have
dropped
to
a
one
-
star
in
my
opinion
!

lots
of
rules
,
phantom
innkeeper
,
last
minute
price
was
worth
it
.

i
called
the
"
207
"
number
and
listened
to
the
same
recording
loop
3
times
before
i
gave
up
.

i
then
called
the
800
number
(
which
was
answered
)
and
inquired
about
last
minute
rates
.

they
had
a
room
with
a
$
99
rate
,
which
i
booked
.

the
room
was
supposed
to
be
on
the
2nd
floor
,
but
they
put
us
on
the
3rd
.

the
email
confirmation
(
which
i
read
in
the
car
)
warned
about
large
suitcases
,
declaring
that
we
are
innkeepers
,
not
longshoreman
.

in
other
words
,
they
do
not
help
with
suitcases
,
but
they
promise
totes
to
help
.

however
upon
our
arrival
no
one
there
(
the
inn
was
open
)
.

so
no
totes
.

finally
a
chambermaid
stuck
her
head
around
the
corner
from
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
told
us
sternly
that
we
could
not
be
accommodated
until
3
m
,
no
exceptions
.

then
she
was
gone
.

we
returned
after
3
pm
,
found
no
one
there
,
and
a
note
from
the
innkeeper
with
directions
to
our
room
.

these

snacks
:
uninspired

i
'd
go

i
could
get
the
last
minute
rate
again
of
$
99
,
but
i
would
n't
pay
their
rack
rate
.

quit
with
the
overstatements
!

the
worst
thing
that
can
happen
for
any
restaurant
like
zahav
is
to
have
too
many
people
write
hyperbolic
reviews
making
claims
that
"
everyone
"
is
going
to
"
love
"
the
food
,
decor
and
service
.

the
truth
is
,
in
my
and
my
dining
partners
'
experience
,
this
is
a
fine
little
restaurant
with
some
unique
food
.

it
's
an
entirely
up
and
down
experience
,
however
.

now
,
the
best
of
that
unique
food
comes
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
meal
.

the
salatim
salads
are
the
smallest
plates
i
've
ever
seen
placed
in
front
of
me
(
you
would
most
likely
think
they
were
condiments
if
it
were
n't
explained
to
you
)
.

though
they
are
mostly
excellent
,
you
generally
do
n't
get
enough
forkfuls
to
know
if
you
really
love
them
.

that
being
said
,
the
laffa
and
hummus
are
out
of
this
world
.

then
again
,
for
the
three
of
us
who
dined
together
,
two
pieces
of
flatbread
left
us
fighting
for
more
,
and
licking
the
hummus
from
our
fingers
(
and
yes
,
those
two
pieces
of
flatbread
did
represent
a
three
-
person
order
)
.

dinner
was
also
an
up
-
and
-
down
experience
.

the
vegetarian
dishes
and
lighter
fare
were
almost
always
spot
-
on
,
while
the
lamb
was
often
dry
and
/
or
overcooked
.

the
duck
was
a
65
%
glob
of
chewy
fat
with
no
resemblance
to
the
juicy
,
crispy
delicacy
it
usually
represents
at
other
establishments
.

dessert
was
...
hmmm
,
that
's
interesting
,
i
do
n't
even
remember
dessert
.

i
guess
that
tells
you
a
lot
.

oh
,
yes
,
the
chocolate
semifreddo
was
quite
good
.

the
warm
chocolate
cake
was
very
tasty
,
but
served
at
room
temperature
,
not
warm
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
.

and
my
--
no
,
i
still
do
n't
remember
what
i
had
.

service
was
average
,
but
nothing
special
,
and
restaurants
that
are
supposed
to
be
excellent
should
do
a
better
job
of
training
their
waitstaff
to
be
communicative
and
friendly
,
not
merely
capable
.

perhaps
had
we
not
gone
into
this
restaurant
believing
zahav
was
going
to
be
golden
as
its
name
suggests
(
and
as
the
many
golden
reviews
seem
to
attest
)
,
we
would
have
enjoyed
a
decent
little
expensive
experience
.

but
one
should
not
go
here
expecting
something
fantastic
,
unless
perhaps
you
've
never
had
middle
-
eastern
food
before
,
or
succulent
duck
,
tasty
lamb
,
decent
portion
sizes
or
actually
warm
chocolate
desserts
.

ps
)
when
we
called
for
a
reservation
,
we
were
told
that
5:00
and
9:30
were
their
only
openings
.

when
we
arrived
at
5
,
and
left
circa
7
,
there
were
the
same
4
or
5
empty
tables
surrounding
us
.

did
they
think
we
were
going
to
feel
lucky
to
get
any
reservation
at
all
,
and
therefore
be
more
pleased
with
our
dining
experience
?

must
read
-
do
not
waste
your
time
in
this
store
.

at
my
appointment
the
girl
helping
me
was
unable
to
adequately
lace
up
some
of
the
dresses
.

they
felt
like
they
were
going
to
fall
off
of
me
and
it
was
very
difficult
to
see
what
i
would
actually
look
like
were
i
to
purchase
some
of
these
dresses
.

i
thought
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
see
how
a
few
that
i
liked
would
look
like
on
a
model
(
by
looking
the
dress
up
online
)
.

so
,
as
i
was
leaving
i
asked
for
the
designer
/
dress
name
or
style
number
associated
with
my
top
picks
.

they
said
they
were
"
unable
to
tell
me
until
they
ordered
my
dress
"
.

hmmm
...
a
person
can
not
call
a
company
,
if
you
have
no
idea
its
name
(
since
the
designer
is
unknown
...
supposedly
)
,
and
order
a
gown
without
a
dress
name
or
style
number
.

do
other
brides
fall
for
this
???

they
either
:
a
)
do
n't
want
to
give
it
to
me
because
they
do
n't
want
me
purchasing
the
dress
elsewhere
or
b
)
are
recreating
the
dresses
themselves
(
ie
stealing
other
designers
'
dress
designs
and
"
filling
the
orders
"
by
their
own
seamstresses
)
.

i
'm
no
detective
but
...
uhh
...
seriously
?!?

whatever
type
of
operation
they
are
running
,
i
'm
not
interested
and
if
you
're
smart
,
you
wo
n't
be
either
.

what
a
waste
of
time
.

aside
from
that
little
*
mystery
*
,
one
of
the
sales
ladies
was
quite
comfortable
telling
me
how
wrong
i
was
about
how
another
dress
that
i
loved
compared
to
one
of
her
dresses
that
i
was
trying
on
.

somehow
,
since
she
supposedly
does
n't
know
any
names
of
designers
/
dresses
,
after
i
told
her
the
designer
and
dress
name
of
the
one
i
was
comparing
,
she
knew
"
exactly
which
dress
"
i
was
referring
to
and
disagreed
with
my
observation
;
she
said
that
the
bodice
did
come
as
low
as
the
one
i
had
on
.

my
point
:
even
if
i
was
wrong
,
do
n't
sit
there
and
argue
with
the
customer
.

say
something
like
,
"
huh
.

i
did
n't
think
so
but
you
could
be
right
.
"

unless
you
want
to
take
the
"
tell
the
customer
how
wrong
she
is
and
try
and
force
her
into
a
dress
she
's
obviously
not
loving
"
approach
which
will
likely
get
you
...
uh
...
nowhere
.

seriously
:
do
not
waste
your
time
.

other
shops
around
this
city
have
much
nicer
and
more
transparent
owners
.

not
owners
that
seem
like
they
have
something
to
hide
and
know
nothing
about
common
courtesy
and
customer
service
.

i
felt
very
much
like
wedding
gallery
was
being
dishonest
and
i
would
n't
trust
them
to
lace
me
up
in
another
gown
let
alone
trust
them
with
the
gown
i
will
wear
on
the
most
important
day
of
my
life
.

awful
service
!

after
happily
visiting
sear's
automotives
in
the
past
,
i
was
shocked
at
the
horrible
service
received
at
their
greensboro
location
.

i
brought
my
car
in
on
a
sunday
to
replace
a
shredded
tire
.

i
waited
about
20
minutes
in
the
store
part
before
anyone
was
able
to
assist
me
and
was
then
told
to
pull
my
car
into
the
shop
(
that
is
apparently
what
you
are
supposed
to
do
,
but
the
big
signs
pointing
you
that
way
are
for
some
reason
kept
inside
the
garage
,
so
you
do
n't
see
them
drving
up
,
and
they
purposely
block
the
front
pull
-
up
that
all
other
sear's
use
)
.

once
inside
,
i
had
to
stand
around
for
at
least
10
more
minutes
before
--
finally
--
a
technician
got
to
me
.

once
i
returned
to
pick
up
my
car
,
you
can
believe
i
spent
quite
a
bit
more
time
standing
around
waiting
.

i
had
wanted
to
split
the
total
between
a
credit
card
and
check
card
since
i
was
being
reimbursed
for
the
tire
but
was
told
this
was
n't
possible
.

once
i
actually
got
back
in
my
car
,
it
was
dirty
and
had
grease
all
over
the
steering
wheel
.

ok
,
one
bad
experience
...
fine
.

the
following
friday
,
i
returned
with
my
car
to
go
ahead
and
replace
the
other
3
tires
,
which
were
worn
.

i
would
not
have
gone
back
,
but
i
could
n't
find
the
particular
tire
they
'd
used
in
stock
anywhere
else
.

once
again
,
i
waited
for
quite
a
bit
before
being
attended
to
.

i
got
the
order
completed
,
and
then
questioned
the
technician
since
it
came
out
about
$
40
less
than
i
expected
.

he
said
it
was
the
same
tire
,
and
verified
this
,
after
checking
both
the
actual
tire
on
my
car
and
my
service
papers
from
earlier
in
the
week
.

however
,
when
he
printed
out
the
service
quote
,
i
could
see
that
it
was
not
the
correct
tire
,
and
was
not
even
an
appropriate
tire
for
my
car
model
.

so
i
pointed
this
out
to
him
,
at
which
point
he
said
they
only
had
one
of
the
correct
tires
in
stock
.

ok
--
fine
.

so
i
got
just
my
other
rear
tire
replaced
.

they
promised
it
'd
be
done
within
an
hour
,
so
i
waited
in
the
lobby
.

over
two
hours
later
(
and
ten
minutes
before
they
closed
)
my
car
was
finally
finished
.

a
few
minutes
after
i
left
,
i
was
called
and
informed
that
"
i
"
left
my
wheel
lock
(
which
they
should
have
left
in
the
car
)
.

of
course
,
they
would
be
closing
in
5
minutes
,
so
i
would
have
to
hurry
up
or
get
it
the
next
day
.

of
course
i
could
n't
make
it
back
in
time
(
and
they
apparently
could
not
stay
5
extra
minutes
to
wait
for
me
)
.

the
next
day
,
no
one
could
find
my
wheel
lock
and
that
particular
technician
was
not
in
.

of
course
,
they
could
n't
call
him
either
to
ask
about
it
because
apparently
they
do
n't
keep
their
employees
'
phone
numbers
(
riiight
)
,
so
i
would
have
to
return
on
monday
(
driving
for
3
days
now
with
no
wheel
lock
should
i
get
a
flat
)
.

on
monday
i
called
and
again
it
was
a
big
to
-
do
to
find
anyone
who
knew
anything
about
it
.

supposedly
they
will
be
holding
it
for
me
this
evening
,
but
i
'm
sure
that
will
also
be
a
huge
ordeal
.

the
employees
at
this
sear's
are
completely
apathetic
and
there
did
n't
seem
to
be
any
sort
of
management
that
i
could
see
.

i
will
never
return
there
again
(
and
now
have
some
serious
doubts
about
the
quality
of
work
they
actually
performed
on
my
car
)
.
the
dude
who
grills
the
retarded
dogs
is
rude
.

if
this
is
the
best
that
tucson
has
to
offer
,
i
am
out
ta
here
...

i
called
on
a
friday
at
12:30
complaining
of
a
severe
toothache
.

dr.
obina
told
me
that
his
office
closed
at
noon
and
that
i
should
call
him
on
monday
.

i
had
been
a
patient
of
dr.
olbina
for
9
years
and
had
spent
thousands
of
dollars
on
crowns
etc
.

there
are
plenty
of
good
dentists
in
fernandina
.

do
n't
go
to
amelia
gentle
dentistry
.

good
location

for
a
hotel
like
this
you
would
expect
some
form
of
free
internet
.

what
you
get
is
a
$
13
/
day
charge
to
access
the
internet
through
a
slow
512
/
512
kb
/
s
that
you
can
only
use
to
check
email
etc
(
read
:
no
downloading
)
.

other
than
that
the
hotel
is
in
a
good
location
and
the
breakfast
is
great

make
you
feel
like
a
number

stay
away
from
kids
first
west
chester
.

you
never
get
a
human
on
the
phone
.

it
's
impossible
to
get
an
appointment
.

if
you
get
caught
in
traffic
and
are
a
couple
minutes
late
they
make
you
re-schedule
...
for
6
weeks
later
.

and
worst
of
all
your
child
feels
like
a
number
not
a
patient
.

go
somewhere
else
.

2010
first
time
eating
at
caffe
bella
italia
and
it
was
a
wonderful
experience
.

from
the
delectable
antipasto
misto
to
the
spaghetti
alla
barese
and
the
parmigiana
and
ending
with
gelato
,
all
was
mouth
watering
.

too
bad
they
were
out
of
the
chocolate
lava
cake
.

maybe
next
time
they
will
have
it
.

service
was
excellent
!

sandy

beware
of
sharayu

hopless
service
,
at
the
time
of
booking
my
car
a
lot
was
promised
but
delivered
not
even
one
tenth
of
what
was
promised
.

apart
from
that
in
spite
of
my
repeated
attempts
i
could
not
get
in
touch
with
the
manager
to
even
lodge
an
official
complaint
.

my
advise
to
all
is
i
have
fallen
into
this
trap
...
pl
ensure
you
do
nt
!!!

course
has
come
a
long
way
!!

hcc
's
new
nine
was
a
little
shaky
at
first
,
but
the
new
grounds
superintendant
has
done
wonders
for
the
course
!!

the
comment
below
definitely
needs
to
be
retracted
!

come
back
and
give
hcc
a
second
chance
at
least
!

it
is
a
great
course
for
local
golfers
to
be
proud
of
and
all
the
comments
in
2008
have
been
very
positive
!!

excellent
physiotherapists
!

kusal
goonewardena
and
his
team
of
physios
are
unbelievable
!

i
have
been
suffering
from
back
pain
for
over
12
years
and
have
been
to
numerous
specialists
,
physios
,
osteos
and
chiros
with
no
help
.

it
took
the
vigor
team
only
4
visits
to
get
me
feeling
normal
!

and
now
2
months
after
my
last
appointment
i
am
better
than
ever
.

thanks
guys
!

they
must
have
read
these
reviews
and
improved
!

my
husband
and
i
happened
in
on
a
whim
.

we
sat
in
the
front
dining
area
,
it
was
very
cozy
and
pleasant
.

our
server
was
quite
attentive
and
the
food
was
fantastic
.

my
husband
has
been
a
professional
chef
,
so
he
is
a
good
judge
of
quality
food
.

this
was
a
flavorful
,
enjoyable
meal
for
both
of
us
.

rude
rude
rude

went
in
there
and
got
my
dog
groomed
came
home
to
an
uneven
dog
then
took
him
back
to
get
evened
up
what
a
mistake
!

she
did
nt
even
let
me
finish
a
sentence
without
insulting
me
and
telling
me
how
i
should
have
said
it
!

i
wo
nt
go
back
!

she
needs
to
develop
a
personality
!

brought
dog
home
and
it
s
all
choppy
now
!

it
's
helpful
to
know
a
quite
a
bit
about
bull
fighting
.

if
you
watch
a
lot
of
fights
(
youtube
)
and
research
some
of
the
history
(
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bullfighting
)
you
will
find
yourself
enjoying
it
a
lot
more
!

also
after
seeing
a
handful
of
bullfights
,
i
can
say
that
they
're
a
lot
more
enjoyable
if
you
're
smashed
(
bac
>=
.15
)
.

all
i
can
say
is
that
i
am
glad
i
went
in
!

the
nurses
are
sweet
as
pie
and
the
doctor
is
wonderful
.

this
place
is
about
healing
,
not
making
a
buck
.

the
followup
visit
is
free
!!

after
going
to
the
hospital
and
paying
er
prices
...
there
is
no
way
i
wo
n't
be
back
here
!!

i
will
be
back
and
telling
everyone
about
this
clinic
.

thank
you
!!

i
just
like
the
fact
that
he
was
able
to
do
the
specific
type
of
repair
i
wanted
(
a
reball
)
and
give
me
the
longest
warranty
and
even
a
lower
price
.

someone
else
i
found
that
said
they
could
do
it
but
wanted
to
charge
me
more
and
give
me
less
warranty
.

it
was
a
no
brainer
really
.

i
choose
console
pros
and
i
'm
happy
i
did
.

this
place
is
bad
.

it
's
dark
,
dingy
&
dirty
.

the
salads
are
limp
and
the
rest
of
the
food
is
n't
any
better
(
ok
,
the
nachos
are
not
too
bad
!
)

this
place
may
have
been
something
sometime
;
but
it
way
past
it
"
sell
by
date
"
.

i
have
eaten
here
twice
in
the
past
year
and
will
not
go
back
and
can
not
recommend
it
.

ham
s
on
friendly
...
rip

this
is
the
original
ham
's
restaurant
,
expanded
into
a
regional
chain
in
the
late
80's
--
but
this
one
is
no
more
.

victim
of
hard
times
and
i
suspect
failing
corporate
management
.

according
to
news
accounts
,
the
company
is
struggling
.

i
have
many
fond
memories
of
my
college
evenings
there
long
ago
.

so
long
ham
s
...
you
will
be
missed
.

we
are
very
pleased
with
the
services
of
first
glass
window
.

our
window
panes
were
so
dirty
that
they
needed
a
specialist
to
come
and
clean
them
.

we
called
few
companies
before
we
decide
to
hire
them
.

they
came
on
time
and
completed
their
work
quickly
.

we
were
very
happy
how
clean
looked
our
windows
.

if
you
have
some
problems
with
your
windows
,
you
should
call
them
.

great
help
even
near
closing
time
!

i
came
in
to
town
for
a
week
and
forgot
my
trainers
!

oh
no
!!

i
came
in
30
min
before
close
and
the
staff
was
super
helpful
.

they
spent
a
lot
of
time
with
me
and
got
me
into
a
great
pair
of
shoes
.

i
think
they
may
even
be
better
than
the
pair
i
have
been
using
this
past
year
!

thanks
run
on
!

great

this
is
a
perfect
place
to
get
your
hair
done

i
have
gone
there
time
and
time
again
whenever
i
need
to
get
my
hair
done
or
when
i
want
a
haircut
.

when
i
get
my
hair
done
there
,
they
use
enough
hairstyling
products
while
it
does
not
ruin
your
hair
.

the
service
is
great
and
during
weekends
it
tends
to
get
busy
,
but
the
wait
is
worthwhile
.

highly
recommend

i
have
worked
with
shannon
as
my
massage
therapist
and
intuitive
bodyworker
for
years
and
have
never
been
disappointed
.

no
matter
what
state
i
am
in
when
i
arrive
,
i
always
leave
feeling
better
.

she
has
not
only
helped
me
through
some
challenging
computer
-
work
and
sports
related
injuries
,
she
was
wonderful
to
work
with
throughout
my
pregnancy
and
beyond
.

i
highly
recommend
her
.

best
store
in
boothbay
harbor

what
a
fantastic
store
,
i
love
this
place
.

not
the
same
old
stuff
that
all
the
other
stores
have
.

their
items
are
very
unique
,
great
quality
,
great
prices
.

they
also
have
the
best
tea
i
ever
had
,
not
at
all
like
the
junk
you
get
at
the
grocery
stores
,
i
stock
up
when
ever
there
because
they
are
closed
in
the
winter
.

the
best

dr.
aster
and
her
team
have
been
a
strong
advocate
in
the
health
of
both
my
daughters
.

dr.
aster
is
very
kind
an
gentle
with
the
children
,
but
also
positive
and
to
the
point
with
the
parents
.

she
is
and
excellent
doctor
to
have
on
one
's
team
.

even
though
i
live
pretty
far
from
her
office
i
still
make
the
trip
so
my
daughters
will
have
the
best
!

my
wife
and
i
avoided
doing
some
fairly
simple
electrical
re-wiring
in
our
home
for
several
years
due
to
overall
hassle
and
cost
involved
.

i
finally
called
matt
from
bonafide
and
he
made
the
project
both
easy
for
us
and
reasonable
.

he
was
prompt
,
knowledgable
,
friendly
,
clean
and
just
an
overall
great
guy
who
obviously
cares
about
his
business
.

i
will
reccommend
his
services
however
/
whenever
possible
!

real
pros

i
've
had
writer
friends
describe
horror
stories
with
their
printers
.

i
tell
them
:
why
not
just
go
with
these
guys
?

richard
joule
and
the
gang
are
pros
from
start
to
finish
.

they
set
out
to
exceed
your
expectations
.

already
i
'm
considering
future
projects
,
and
i
can
assure
you
that
for
my
printing
needs
i
will
be
choosing
no
other
than
atlanta
paperback
book
printing
.

i
have
been
here
3
times
and
all
3
times
it
has
been
bad
!

they
have
messed
up
my
order
and
....
the
food
was
just
not
good
!

i
had
sonic
in
many
other
palces
but
for
some
reason
this
sonic
is
always
just
covered
in
grease
and
not
good
...
:(

i
hope
they
get
there
act
together
...

i
am
going
to
give
it
one
last
chance
in
next
few
months
and
see
??

i
called
them
for
an
estimate
and
they
insulted
me
when
i
ask
them
questions
.

they
are
very
rude
and
nasty
.

please
do
n't
use
this
moving
company
if
you
do
n't
want
to
:
cry
,
have
trouble
and
a
bad
experience
on
the
day
of
your
move
.

they
will
give
you
a
low
price
over
the
phone
and
on
the
day
of
your
move
they
will
change
the
price
,
i
guarantee
it
.

you
've
got
maids
did
a
fabulous
job
cleaning
my
home
.

i
am
hiring
them
to
come
once
a
week
now
that
they
got
my
house
to
where
they
can
maintain
it
for
only
an
hour
and
a
half
every
two
weeks
!

satisfactory
for
sure
with
the
sercvice
!

beats
having
one
"
cleaning
lady
"
who
took
twice
as
long
and
did
not
do
a
very
through
job
like
the
"
maids
"
did
!

this
place
has
the
best
baby
and
children
s
clothes
.

especially
high
end
keep
sake
sort
of
clothing
that
you
just
ca
nt
find
in
a
lot
of
stores
.

it
is
all
very
unique
and
you
wo
nt
find
any
other
baby
wearing
the
same
stuff
.

i
spent
quite
a
bit
because
i
spoil
my
little
princess
.

after
all
she
will
only
be
a
baby
for
so
long
i
figure
why
not
enjoy
it
.

antique
lighting
,
fixtures
,
chicago

great
place
for
antique
lighting
!

i
visited
their
huge
chicago
lighting
showroom
and
all
i
have
to
say
is
wow
!!

lots
of
collections
,
many
antique
light
fixtures
,
chandeliers
,
custom
lighting
etc
.

i
think
they
have
the
largest
collection
for
chandeliers
chicago
.

antiques
,
vintage
,
contemporary
&
modern
chandeliers
.

i
would
recommend
them
for
any
custom
lighting
or

and
restoration
chicago

great
food
awesome
food
awesome
service

i
wanted
to
try
someplace
new
again
.

this
place
rocked
.

brought
my
wife
deb
with
me
and
she
like
the
fried
crab
wontons
and
said
they
were
good
..

we
also
had
the
bbq
spare
ribs
..
good
also
.

i
ordered
the
moo
shu
pork
and
it
was
great
..

i
also
ordered
the
neptune
platter
which
was
awesome
...
so
this
place
gets
5
out
of
5
stars
.

do
not
go
here
!!!

i
went
to
get
my
nails
filled
friday
,
by
monday
2
were
broken
.

i
was
not
happy
with
the
way
they
looked
,
very
wavy
,
uneven
edges
,
and
with
the
exception
of
1
,
there
is
a
dip
in
the
center
of
each
nail
.

i
also
had
a
pedicure
,
and
they
cut
my
nails
too
short
,
one
of
my
big
toes
looks
like
it
s
getting
infected
.

no
way
.

i
'm
certainly
no
expert
on
asian
food
in
fact
not
even
a
lover
of
vietnamese
food
but
i
wanted
to
try
the
real
things
here
at
a
dong
.

cold
,
slimy
,
tasteless
however
is
the
same
in
all
languages
and
foods
.

not
good
,
not
great
,
and
again
another
disappointment
in
central
iowa
.

how
do
these
places
stay
in
business
.

this
town
needs
some
food
soul
and
this
is
not
it
.

worth
every
penny

my
girlfriend
and
i
ate
at
the
grill
last
night
,
and
our
experience
was
amazing
.

everything
we
ordered
was
prepared
to
perfection
,
and
was
presented
perfectly
.

the
asparagus
,
seared
tuna
,
and
lobster
tail
were
the
best
we
ever
had
.

then
the
desserts
came
,
and
they
were
hands
down
the
best
dessert
we
ever
had
.

i
will
sum
it
up
with
,
it
was
worth
every
penny
!

best
chinese
restaurant
ever
!!!

it
was
the
best
chinese
food
i
have
ever
had
.

all
the
food
tasted
excellent
,
and
with
the
new
renovation
of
chairs
and
the
bathroom
,
it
is
awesome
.

the
people
working
their
are
also
extremely
polite
and
friendly
.

every
time
i
go
,
kevin
,
the
manager
,
will
always
remember
my
family
and
i
.

overall
,
it
is
very
family
oriented
,
and
i
recommend
it
to
everyone
!!!

professional
and
inspiring

nigel
from
nidd
design
has
always
provided
a
first
class
service
,
from
his
advice
and
professionalism
to
the
quality
of
his
design
drawings
and
planning
applications
.

his
knowledge
and
expertise
help
smooth
the

ensuring

once

he
really
does
turn
your
dreams
into
reality
for

!

we
came
at
around
730
and
they
close
at
8
and
wanted
to
try
the
specials
but
they
were
out
for
the
day
so
i
would
say
go
way
before
they
close
.

got
the
crab
rangoon
which
was
great
,
tofu
with
cabbage
which
was
spicy
but
good
and
shrimp
satay
which
was
also
good
.

def
going
to
come
back
and
try
this
place
again
.

bea
was
really
nice
and
asked
how
the
food
was
.

cute
place
also

as
a
native
southern
californian
i
can
tell
you
that
this
is
not
authentic
mexican
food
.

however
,
i
still
like
this
place
a
lot
.

esp.
the
mole
,
tortilla
soup
,
and
guacamole
.

margaritas
are
alright
.

my
only
complaint
is
the
queso
.

it
used
to
be
fabulous
,
why
did
you
guys
change
it
??

queso
should
not
be
watery
:(
.....

***
update
***
never
mind
!

they
fixed
the
queso
!

at
all
.

in
fact
my
friend
vomited
after
our
meal
.

maybe
we
ordered
the
wrong
dish
but
my
experience
here
was
poor
.

service
was
okay
not
great
,
we
came
for
a
late

i
do

small
firm
with
great
service

bloom
legal
was
really
attentive
to
my
problem
,
and
seth
bloom
took
the
time
to
help
me
understand
the
legal
issue
i
was
dealing
with
.

i
much
preferred
the
one
-
on
-
one
service
here
to
the
experiences
i
've
had
with
bigger
offices
and
firms
.

while
i
hope
i
do
n't
have
any
need
for
a
lawyer
anytime
soon
,
if
i
do
i
'll
definitely
use
this
firm
again
.

used
their
service
for
the
first
time
and
was
immediately
impressed
by
their
professionalism
(
received
a
phone
call
soon
after
order
was
placed
to
confirm
details
)
and
the
subsequent
delivery
of
my
gift
(
to
split
,
croatia
)
was
as
requested
.

the
gift
itself
was
exactly
as
described
and
pictured
in
the
catalogue
and
of
the
highest
standard
.

would
highly
recommend
to
anyone
requiring
overseas

love
my

!

fitness

is
a
second
home
to
a
lot
of
us
gym
members
who
work
out
daily
.

if

non-commercial
like
atmosphere
then
you
have
chosen
the
best
place
to
be
.

this
is
the
most

do
n't
be
surprised
when
you
see
how
addicting
going
to
fitness

can
be
!!

over-rated
...

this
restaurant
is
over-rated
.

it
is
hard
to
find
...
and
the
mexican
food
is
bland
,
almost
equivalent
to
eating
out
of
a
can
.

the
service
is
poor
...

i
asked
for
a
fried
egg
on
my
enchiladas
...
and
did
not
get
it
.!

secondly
,
the
enchladas
did
not
come
with
enchilada
sauce
..
but
chili
...
like
hormel
's
chili
..
the
cheese
was
american
cheese
!

the
chili
relleno
..
had
no
batter
on
it
.

i
googled
restaurants
in
the
area
and
fuji
sushi
came
up
and
reviews
were
great
so
i
made
a
carry
out
order
of
:
l
17
.

mixed
tempura
.....................
8.25
shrimp
or
vegetable
tempura
&
salad
.

i
was
very
happy
with
the
customer
service
and
even
more
please
with
the
portion
size
,
to
go
box
set
up
and
quality
of
the
food
for
the
price
.

i
'm
very
happy
and
will
definitely
dine
in
and
carry
out
again
.

good
pizza
at
a
good
price

i
just
moved
nearby
and
have
tried
several
of
the
local
places
,
this
was
the
first
one
and
i
should
have
just
stuck
with
it
.

the
pizza
is
usually
pretty
good
,
the
only
bad
one
we
got
was
on
a
friday
night
and
it
just
needed
to
be
cooked
a
little
more
,
but
it
was
still
good
.

their
bbq
chicken
pizza
is
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
ever
had
.

horrible
service
!!!

absolute
horrible
service
from
the
parts
department
.

they
are
very
rude
over
the
phone
and
in
person
.

they
talk
down
to
you
like
they
are
supreme
beings
,
if
you
hate
your
job
so
much
then
quit
!!

how
these
guys
can
get
away
with
being
so
rude
with
people
is
mind
blowing
.

i
will
never
do
business
with
sun
toyota
again
.

thank
god
there
are
plenty
of
toyota
dealerships
to
choose
from
in
this
city
.

this
is
a
good
place

i
have
been
here
before
and
the
service
was
absoulutely
great
.

they
had
a
great
selection
of
colors
to
choose
from
and
their
seats
are
super
comfty
.

i
enjoy
going
there
although
i
've
only
been
there
once
,
i
will
be
returning
toda
to
recieve
a
pair
of
french
tips
and
i
will
only
go
to
the
best
and
to
me
the
best
is
here
.

i
reccomend
you
to
go
and
enjoy
their
wonderful
hospitality
.

anna
marie
and
govind
are
very
sweet
people
,
and
the
minute
you
steep
into
their
school
,
the
calm
loving
atmosphere
takes
over
,
and
tension
and
worries
stay
outside
in
the
street
,
whether
or
not
you
pick
them
up
again
after
class
is
probably
a
question
of
practice
.

a
wonderful
place
,
if
you
want
more
than
just
the
physical
side
of
yoga
.

give
yourself
the
gift
of
trying
this
place
,
to
see
if
it
fits
you
...

they
do
n't
seem
to
be
interested
in
selling
cars
.

went
there
yesterday
:
we
are
trying
to
decide
between
two
different
honda
models
,
so
we
wanted
to
test
-
drive
both
back
to
back
.

the
salesperson
refused
!

claimed
he
was
too
busy
for
two
test
drives
.

we
were
the
only
customers
there
!

do
n't
waste
time
,
just
drive
10
minutes
more
down
to
stevens
creek
,
they
actually
do
try
to
help
their
customers
there
!

ate
here
a
couple
times
.

it
is
not
a
high
end
steak
house
,
more
of
the
cuisine
brett
enjoys
in
mississippi
.

so
,
if
you
want
a
burger
and
fries
,
well
,
it
is
ok
.

if
you
want
a
little
cajunish
food
-
it
is
good
.

if
you
want
a
steak
,
well
,
this
is
not
the
best
in
green
bay
.

overall
decent
but
if
you
are
expecting
a
ruth
chris
type
steak
,
this
is
not
it
.

eulogic

good
place
to
be
on
a
sunday
night
.

the
beers
were
good
,
nice
choice
of
beers
as
well
,
and
as
usual
the
mussels
were
great
,
the
place
upstairs
is
a
nice
addition
to
the
bar
downstairs
.

filled
up
on
too
much
beer
and
hence
can
not
comment
on
the
food
.

but
the
menu
had
standard
stuff
that
one
would
get
at
a
belgian
tavern
.

if
you
are
a
handcraft
beer
person
,
this
is
a
fantastic
place
to
be
.

perfect
location
plus

i
moved
into
the
tanglewood
apartments
in
late
2008
and
it
's
been
a
refreshing
change
.

i
used
to
live
at
meadowrun
and
that
was
a
nightmare
.

the
manager
-
tiffany
-
is
actually
very
nice
so
i
'm
a
bit
surprised
by
other
comments
.

she
's
very
reachable
and
she
has
always
responded
quickly
to
any
questions
or
requests
.

plus
she
plans
a
monthly
breakfasts
and
other
events
at
the
clubhouse
which
is
a
nice
added
benefit
.

great
service
/
deals
-
support
this
local
business

i
have
used
these
guys
for
new
snows
,
fixing
lots
of
flats
,
used
replacement
tires
,
and
oil
changes
.

they
have
the
best
prices
locally
and
good
customer
service
.

one
guy
is
a
little
surley
,
but
who
gives
a
crap
as
long
as
your
car
's
work
is
outstanding
.

and
they
're
usually
able
to
help
you
as
a
walk
-
in
,
and
they
're
fast
.

overall
-
good
stuff
.

another
great
business
bites
the
dust
!

the
best
cakes
ever
!

a
bit
pricey
,
so
i
did
n't
go
very
often
,
but
it
was
always
a
treat
when
i
did
.

the
prices
were
worth
what
i
got
.

i
'm
assuming
they
are
completely
out
of
business
since
i
ca
n't
find
any
contact
information
.

i
'm
hoping
the
bakers
continue
to
do
their
baking
out
of
another
place
,
because
it
would
be
a
shame
not
to
have
these
cakes
any
longer
.

super
nice
people
,
really
good
food

what
i
love
most
about
this
place
,
other
than
the
food
,
is
that
eating
here
makes
you
feel
like
you
're
in
a
small
town
rather
than
baltimore
.

the
owners
are
really
nice
,
they
serve
good
food
at
a
good
price
,
and
the
option
to
eat
outside
on
the
deck
(
esp
on
the
weekend
whether
there
is
hardly
any
traffic
)
is
great
.

one
of
my
top
5
places
to
eat
in
baltimore
.

overpriced

this
place
is
identical
to
the
youngstown
sports
grille
,
so
i
imagine
they
are
owned
/
operated
by
the
same
people
.

the
food
is
mediocre
at
best
,
and
largely
overpriced
given
the
portion
size
and
quality
.

do
n't
even
get
me
started
on
how
expensive
it
is
to
drink
there
.

i
have
ate
here
3
times
since
they
first
opened
,
and
the
service
has
been
poor
each
time
,
the
staff
always
comes
across
as
somewhat
rude
and
slow
.

(

enjoyed
this
cozy
little
spot
with
a
group
of
8
folks
.

service
was
excellent
.

food
was
excellent
.

wine
was
excellent
.

i
was
feeling
the
need
for
some
fish
so
i
had
the
salmon
which
was
very
good
but
the
steaks
looked
amazing
and
if
i
am
in
town
again
,
i
'll
definitely
order
a
steak
.

a
perfect
place
for
a
romantic
dinner
.

lots
of
"
pretty
people
"
dining
inside
.

great
staff
.

very
helpful
!!!!

they
interviewed
me
,
gave
me
tests
in
the
software
i
included
on
my
resume
,
and
placed
me
in
a
position
that
i
kept
for
several
years
.

re-interviewed
and
am
going
on
interviews
for
a
new
job
.

i
'm
really
thankful
for
the
folks
at
hr
office
.

they
are
dependable
,
have
great
connections
in
the
community
,
and
are
a
great
resource
for
finding
a
job
.

i
highly
recommend
them
to
all
of
my
friends
!!!!
!

great
experience
-
consider
checking
out
their
puppies
before
buying
from
a
breeder
!

i
adopted
a
3.5
month
old
yellow
lab
last
winter
from
the
dumb
friends
league
.

the
staff
was
very
helpful
in
finding
the
right
dog
for
me
and
the
care
my
pup
received
was
outstanding
.

if
you
are
on
the
lookout
for
a
pure
breed
pup
do
n't
forget
to
check
out
the
shelters
!

my
pup
has
a
wonderful
temperment
and
has
been
a
wonderful
addition
to
my
family
!

food
good
,
service
poor

no
silverware
,
asked
for
a
spoon
for
my
son
s
mac
and
cheese
ended
up
having
to
use
my
tea
spoon
.

asked
for
bar
-
b
-
que
sauce
never
got
it
.

never
checked
back
with
us
once
we
got
our
food
.

had
to
go
the
the
bus
boy
s
station
ourselves
to
get
napkins
.

only
one
server
,
too
buys
talking
with
others
i
guess
.

food
was
good
,
but
service
means
a
lot
to
me
.

dr.
chao
you
are
the
best
dentist
i
have
ever
had
.

you
are
knowledgeable
,
professional
,
gentel
and
kind
.

i
wish
i
had
you
as
my
dentist
early
on
in
my
life
-
maybe
my
teeth
would
have
been
a
lot
better
then
they
are
now
,
however
i
am
glad
you
are
my
dentist
now
.

even
though
you
are
expensive
.

thank
you
for
helping
to
preserve
my
teeth
.

you
are
meticulous
in
your
work
and
it
shows
in
my
smile
.

con
garage

i
brought
my
car
in
for
a
simple
emissions
test
.

i
guess
they
figured
me
for
an
easy
mark
,
and
tried
to
explain
that
my
car
would
n't
pass
unless
i
replaced
a
hose
.

ten
minutes
later
,
i
took
my
car
down
the
street
and
it
passed
the
emissions
test
with
flying
colors
.

if
you
're
a
fan
of
herpes
,
being
ripped
off
,
and
child
molesters
,
this
is
the
garage
for
you
.

if
not
,
go
somewhere
else
.

rude
service

even
though
i
have
never
tried
hoa
salon
but
i
agree
with
other
reviewers
that
they
are
rude
.

i
called
and
asked
about
the
price
for
hair
updo
and
the
receptionist
or
owner
who
aswered
the
phone
refused
to
tell
me
,
or
even
just
give
me
an
approximate
price
range
.

he
told
us
to
stop
by
the
salon
and
then
he
will
tell
us
the
price
.

what
kind
of
rude
service
is
that
?

i
do
n't
want
to
waste
my
time
with
them
.

top
notch
eats
!

so
here
we
are
in
manson
.

manson
?

yes
,
manson
.

right
near
chelan
.

aka
nowheresville
.

and
this
litttle
gem
of
a
7
-
table
restaurant
is
a
complete
and
utterly
wonderful
surprise
.

a
short
but
wide
-
ranging
menu
executed
with
innovative
perfection
in
a
cozy
hole
in
the
wall
just
off
the
main
street
.

fantastic
food
served
without
pretense
,
very
reasonably
priced
wine
selections
.

a
great
place
to
go
for
dinner
after
a
day
of
wine
tasting
.

excellent
service
and
reasonable
prices

boutique
stores
dealing
in
children
's
clothing
/
gifts
are
often
outrageously
priced
(
who
wants
to
pay
40
dollars
for
a
newborn
onesie
?
)

but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
that
the
purple
goose
's
prices
are
reasonable
(
for
the
same
products
found
at
other
area
boutiques
,
the
prices
were
20
-
25
%
cheaper
)
.

the
service
was
also
excellent
-
friendly
,
helpful
and
informative
without
being
overbearing
.

will
definitely
return
.

consistantly
poor

a
lack
of
organisation
,
coupled
with
the
distain
for
its
customers
,
makes
this
the
worst
rental
agency
i
have
used
.

chasing
them
on
issues
from
the
day
i
moved
in
(
many
of
them
still
unresolved
as
i
left
)
to
all
sorts
of
farcical
issues
with
funds
,
after
i
left
.
.
.
.
as
soon
as
i
could
.

if
you
must
use
them
,
be
vigilant
and
be
ready
to
push
,
if
you
can
go
elsewhere
then
i
would
.

amazing
night
-
great
party
spot
!!

went
to
the
willow
lounge
this
past
weekend
for
dinner
and
drinks
...
place
is
awesome
.

had
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
a
/
c
broke
,
i
feel
bad
it
was
their
opening
!

anyway
,
once
that
is
fixed
,
this
place
will
be
amazing
.

drinks
were
awesome
,
prices
reasonable
,
and
staff
friendly
.

this
is
an
awesome
date
spot
that
the
area
seriously
needs
.

check
out
the
willow
lounge
,
you
ll
be
happy
!

it
s
been
a
few
years
since
i
have
been
to
ipanema
.

but
my
wife
and
i
first
went
there
thinking
it
would
be
brazilian
food
(
think
lots
of
meat
)
,
but
it
turned
out
to
be
a
vegan
restaurant
!

and
,
i
can
say
,
this
was
one
of
my
favorite
places
to
eat
in
all
of
richmond
.

amazing
!

do
n't
let
the
nondescript
building
entrance
fool
you
,
these
are
some
creative
and
talented
chefs
...
two
thumbs
way
,
way
up
!

excellent
food
,
fantastic
wait
staff

i
recently
threw
a
surprise
birthday
party
for
my
wife
at
fraiser
's
.

we
had
30
guests
for
the
event
,
and
everyone
came
away
from
the
evening
impressed
with
not
only
the
food
,
but
the
outstanding
service
as
well
.

the
management
was
easy
to
deal
with
during
the
planning
stages
,
and
the
execution
by
the
kitchen
and
wait
staff
was
flawless
.

i
highly
recommend
fraiser
's
for
anyone
planning
a
special
event
for
friends
,
family
or
business
.

fantastic
store
!!!

i
came
upon
this
store
as
the
building
caught
my
eye
.

it
's
located
in
the
huge
honka
log
homes
building
,
by
walmart
off
of
evergreen
parkway
.

the
store
was
decorated
with
furnishings
&
accessories
.

the
friendly
crew
working
was
great
&
very
helpful
.

this
store
is
what
colorado
is
all
about
.

also
,
i
purchased
some
furniture
last
year
and
all
has
been
great
!

it's
durability
&
look
was
perfect
and
i
will
definitely
be
adding
to
my
collection
soon
!

lovely
people
,
great
hats

i
was
saddened
to
see
the
reviews
that
claimed
world
hats
mart
has
poor
service
.

it
led
me
to
believe
that
the
reviewers
simply
had
difficulty
tolerating
people
with
strongly
-
accented
english
.

the
husband
and
wife
who
run
this
spot
are
lovely
people
.

we
have
had
many
conversations
with
them
and
they
have
always
been
extremely
patient
with
me
as
i
tried
on
multiple
hats
in
search
of
the
right
costumes
for
my
magic
act
.

i
recommend
them
highly
!

do
nt
ever
go
there
,
not
even
if
your
car
flips
.

their
service
sucks
to
start
off
with
,
people
are
cruel
and
ignorant
.

i
'm
compeltly
dissatisfied
with
their
service
and
their
products
.

they
do
not
have
a
return
policy
and
even
if
their
product
sucks
,
they
will
not
take
it
back
!

do
not
ever
go
here
.

i
prefer
advanced
auto
parts
over
this
crappy
place
with
the
meanest
people
.

and
they
thrive
to
get
a
customer
.

do
not
go
here
..
thank
you

horrible

i
have
been
growing
my
hair
out
for
1
year
plus
and
went
in
to
get
1
inch
taken
off
.

i
walked
out
with
5
inch
long
hair
on
the
top
,
2
inch
long
hair
on
the
sides
,
and
1.5
in
the
back
.

my
hair
is
uneven
and
it
looks
rediculous
.

this
woman
should
be
working
in
supercuts
...
if
that
.

this
was
a
terrible
experience
and
i
hope
that
no
one
else
goes
through
that
.

do
your
self
a
favor
and
do
not
go
to
this
establishment
.

the
worst
burger
king
restaurant
!!!

i
generally
like
the
bk
over
the
other
fast
serving
restaurants
;
however
,
i
regreted
to
visit
this
restaurant
at
my
town
.

this
is
a
shame
of
my
adorable
town
,
branford
.

i
ordered
a
kid
meal
with
a
milk
and
found
a
bottle
was
half
opened
already
.

i
asked
them
to
change
it
but
they
rudely
said
that
it
was
okay
.

disgusting
french
fries
is
very
best
menu
.

do
n't
go
,
or
you
will
learn
how
to
waste
your
money
.

disappointed

the
bad
:
i
was
at
napa
recently
and
was
unpleasantly
surprised
at
poor
waiter
svce
and
subpar
food
.

we
were
a
party
of
4
and
none
of
us
were
particularly
pleased
with
our
dishes
.

napa
is
all
about
wine
but
gives
very
short
descriptions
of
the
wines
on
their
lists
.

i
found
my
initial
selection
satisfactory
but
the
wine
flight
we
chose
to
be
poorly
composed
.

if
you
must
go
ask
lots
of
questions
about
your
selections
since
your
expectations
may
as
high
as
mine
were
.

highly
recommended

we
walked
in
to
pick
our
little
man
at
10
minutes
to
closing
and
heard
laughter
from
kids
and
the
staff
.

the
facilities
are
more
than
adequate
and
the
staff
are
just
phenomenal
.

their
sense
of
humour
and
calmness
when
dealing
with
the
little
ones
amazes
me
every
time
i
walk
in
.

we
have
since
moved
slightly
further
away
from
the
centre
but
it
's
worth
the
extra
travel
,
as
the
care
provided
exceeds
our
expectations
...
especially
after
a
few
horrendous
daycare
experiences
elsewhere
.

horrible
!!!!
!

this
has
to
be
some
of
the
worst
pizza
i
have
ever
had
the
misfortune
of
ordering
.

the
crust
was
lopsided
,
thicker
on
one
side
than
the
other
.

it
actually
had
a
hole
in
one
of
the
slices
.

there
was
minimal
cheese
and
sauce
and
it
completely
lacked
flavor
.

i
know
new
york
pizza
and
this
is
not
it
!!

this
was
nothing
like
new
york
style
pizza
!!!.

i
love
pizza
and
this
was
a
complete
and
utter
disappointment
!!

i
would
not
suggest
this
pizza
to
anyone
!!!

best
quote
ever
my
gate
was
stuck
halfway
open
so
i
called
a
class
garage
doors
dr
services
.

they
came
to
my
house
in
no
time
and
started
working
on
the
gate
.

they
were
very
friendly
and
were
able
to
explain
me
exactly
what
was
wrong
with
it
.

once
they
fixed
it
they
answetred
all
of
my
questions
with
no
hesitations
and
then
gave
me
the
best
quote
ever
.

i
know
that
if
my
garage
door
needs
to
be
repaired
,
i
will
be
calling
a
class
garage
doors

you
will
be
happy
at
this
store
!

allen
tire
was
recommended
by
friend
after
my
having
bad
tire
experiences
in
temecula
.

the
store
manager
,
jim
smith
,
made
an
excellent
tire
recommendation
for
my
newly
acquired
lexus
.

tires
were
the
right
price
and
now
the
car
feels
like
it
is
riding
on
rails
around
turns
.

the
store
is
clean
,
run
very
professionally
and
a
pleasure
to
be
in
.

they
know
their
job
and
you
do
not
have
to
watch
them
to
be
sure
everything
is
done
right
.

easiest
time
i
ever
had
purchasing
a
car
!

excellent
service
,
not
only
did
they
get
the
exact
car
i
wanted
win
in
48
hours
but
the
sales
man
also
took
me
out
to
lunch
.

very
kind
and
reliable
.

i
highly
recommend
this
dealership
if
you
would
not
like
to
hassle
on
price
and
receive
friendly
service
.

i
have
since
purchased
two
cars
from
this
dealership
,
the
first
one
was
from
phillip
and
the
second
was
from
richard
.

both
were
excellent
sales
men
who
put
my
needs
first
.

this
place
has
done
a
great
job
of
taking
care
of
the
usual
maintenance
on
my
hooptie
.

i
also
never
have
to
wait
long
for
a
yearly
inspection
sticker
...
and
never
get
the
usual
excuses
other
shops
always
gave
me
...
"
the
inspection
guy
is
n't
here
today
"
....
for
example
.

today
i
went
into
kwik
kar
and
there
were
two
cars
in
front
of
me
for
inspection
...
but
i
was
still
out
of
there
pretty
quick
...
barely
had
time
to
read
a
chapter
in
my
book
.

extremely
helpful
and
professional

as
first
-
time
home
buyers
,
my
husband
and
i
found
stephanie
fairchild
at
prudential
steamboat
realty
,
extremely
helpful
.

she
worked
with
us
for
over
a
year
,
helping
us
find
our
perfect
home
.

stephanie
's
knowledge
of
the
market
and
properties
in
our
price
range
,
made
us
feel
secure
in
our
decision
to
buy
when
we
did
.

we
would
highly
recommend
stephanie
to
anyone
looking
for
a
home
in
the
yampa
valley
.

we
appreciated
her
patience
,
knowledge
and
kindness
!

great
barber

firstly
,
the
other
reviewer
clearly
has
never
been
to
nick
's
,
or
he
would
know
that
nick
only
charges
$
13
for
a
haircut
which
is
pretty
much
industry
standard
.

i
have
been
going
to
nick
for
5
months
now
precisely
because
he
does
pay
attention
to
detail
.

i
have
terrible
hair
and
he
really
takes
his
time
to
make
it
look
right
.

some
of
the
younger
kids
that
work
there
are
a
bit
sub
par
,
but
if
you
wait
for
nick
...
you
'll
be
good
.

ugh
!!!

got
some
nice
"
freshly
baked
"
fruit
squares
,
a
personal
favorite
of
mine
.

took
a
bite
,
it
tasted
odd
.

flipped
the
square
over
and
saw
it
riddled
with
green
mold
!!!!

ugh
!!

i
called
the
store
and
the
clerk
giggled
,
and
agreed
that
it
was
gross
,
but
said
it
was
not
her
problem
.

she
also
refused
to
get
a
manager
.

i
left
my
number
,
or
tried
to
anyway
.

same
clerk
had
considerable
difficulty
taking
down
a
number
.

i
'll
never
go
back
there
again

for
cheap
chinese
food
,
this
is
the
place
to
go
.

i
used
to
eat
at
places
like
new
china
or
green
buffet
in
troy
,
mo
-
nothing
terrible
but
not
that
great
.

now
,
i
wo
n't
eat
fast
food
chinese
unless
it
's
from
this
place
.

the
best
value
i
've
found
from
a
chinese
restaurant
.

i
do
n't
live
in
lake
st.
louis
anymore
,
but
deliveries
were
always
correct
and
the
service
courteous
.

now
i
have
to
be
in
the
area
to
get
some
lovin'
:
sad
face
:

amazing
experience
!

my
experience
was
amazing
at
providence
aesthetics
and
medical
spa
.

jana
kueck
was
nothing
but
professional
.

she
makes
you
feel
like
you
are
the
most
important
person
in
the
world
.

jana
made
me
feel
very
comfortable
.

provided
me
with
warm
blanket
and
has
soft
music
playing
.

walking
in
the
door
you
are
made
to
feel
happy
and
relaxed
.

equipment
is
state
of
the
art
.

i
would
reccomend
anyone
to
go
see
jana
kueck
and
robin
talley
to
see
all
the
many
procedures
they
have
to
offer
.

dave
is
a
patient
and
methodical
teacher
,
who
has
a
great
ear
and
sensitivity
for
his
students
'
passion
and
the
direction
they
want
their
lessons
to
take
.

also
,
he
loves
teaching
so
much
,
his
price
is
unbeatable
,
but
that
does
not
change
his
level
of
skill
.

dave
has
much
to
offer
.

in
just
2
-
3
focused
lessons
,
i
'm
already
now
capable
of
picking
up
new
songs
off
youtube
guitar
how
to
videos
and
am
even
writing
my
own
orginals
with
confidence

we
love
our
new
roof
!

we
would
like
to
thank
you
for
the
roofing
job
you
did
on
our
home
.

everything
was
done
on
a
timely
manner
and
things
were
cleaned
and
picked
up
every
day
when
the
crew
was
done
.

we
also
liked
the
way
that
ray
checked
on
the
job
every
day
.

and
when
the
job
was
done
every
thing
was
cleaned
up
and
hauled
off
that
same
day
.

we
would
not
hesitate
to
use
spears
roofing
again
.

we
have
already
recommended
you
to
some
of
our
friends
!

omfg

i
fucking
hate
this
place
every
time
i
go
this
hot
chick
shows
up
and
i
mean
really
hot
but
she
is
like
reaaaally
dumb
and
then
their
is
this
other
chick
that
is
realy
ugly
but
she
is
like
super
smart
she
could
be
a
scientist
,
but
then
their
is
this
stoner
who
always
comes
here
high
and
he
always
brings
his
fucking
dog
who
is
so
high
from
the
second
hand
smoke
i
think
he
is
trying
to
talk
.

anyway
we
drive
around
in
my
van
and
solve
mysterys
and
shit

amazingly
yummy
!

i
just
got
back
from
france
yesterday
and
just
missed
the
food
already
!

my
sister
in
law
told
me
about
this
amazing
new
crepe
place
in
town
,
i
was
so
excited
i
just
wanted
to
go
and
test
it
out
for
my
self
!

their
customer
service
was
perfect
!

their
food
was
better
then
anything
i
had
ever
tasted
.

even
in
france
!

i
would
highly
recommend
this
place
to
anyone
looking
for
a
great
atmosphere
,
amazing
food
,
and
great
customer
service
!

thank
you
roll
up
crepes
!

this
is
one
of
the
worst
places
i
have
stayed
,
we
cut
out
stay
short
and
went
to
the
mulberry
.

even
though
they
still
charge
you
the
days
you
booked
but
wo
n't
use
,
it
is
worth
the
get
the
hell
out
of
this
crap
hole
.

the
whole
experience
shows
a
hotel
managed
by
what
must
be
a
2
star
hotel
manager
.

bad
service
starting
from
the
front
desk
.

the
best
person
is
the
valet
.

short
of
that
,
avoid
this
place
,
as
a
silver
marriott
member
,
this
is
a
disgrace
.

best
place
in
ames

i
lived
here
for
two
years
when
the
prices
were
a
little
lower
:)
the
places
are
very
nice
and
clean
,
and
in
great
condition
!

i
really
enjoyed
the
staff
at
wessex
,
also
the
manager
sherri
was
always
very
nice
and
helpful
.

the
fitness
center
was
great
!

the
only
problem
that
i
had
in
2
years
of
living
there
was
that
the
walls
are
pretty
thin
,
sometimes
i
could
here
my
neighbors
conversations
.

i
would
recommend
these
apartments
to
anybody
!

i
absolutely
loved
living
there
.

the
best
service
ever
!!

i
have
never
had
better
service
.

my
car
broke
down
and
roadside
towed
my
vehicle
to
sussman
kia
.

they
squeezed
me
in
and
had
me
back
up
and
running
in
no
time
.

everyone
was
pleasant
and
very
helpful
.

the
service
department
even
gave
me
a
ride
home
and
picked
me
up
when
my
car
was
finished
.

the
advisor
kept
me
up
to
date
and
informed
on
the
progress
of
my
vehicle
.

i
give
this
dealer
an
a
+
!

i
will
definitely
be
bringing
my
car
back
for
service
.

heaven
on
earthhhhhhh

friendly
,
fine
food

the
one
-
star
review
from
2005
is
out
of
date
.

there
was
a
change
of
ownership
a
couple
of
years
ago
and
service
is
both
quick
and
extremely
friendly
.

the
food
continues
to
be
very
good
--
deli
sandwiches
,
homemade
soups
,
fresh
salads
.

the
atmosphere
may
not
be
for
everyone
.

it
is
a
bustling
place
where
separate
parties
are
seated
at
the
same
table
(
as
in
many
european
cafes
)
,
but
if
you
are
ok
with
that
,
the
food
is
very
good
.

love
the
soups
.

the
new
italian
kid
on
the
block

another
italian
restaurant
in
collingswood
?

do
we
need
another
one
?

only
if
it
is
of
the
quality
of
that
's
amore
.

the
menu
has
the
usual
but
then
they
step
it
up
another
notch
.

the
arancini
di
riso
(
risotto
fritters
)
are
not
to
be
missed
.

chicken
saltimboca
was
excellent
and
then
there
's
the
chocolate
mousse
that
comes
straight
from
heaven
.

pay
extra
attention
to
the
appetizers
-
the
next
time
i
go
there
i
'm
planning
on
ordered
a
few
instead
of
an
entree
.

auto
towing
is
one
of
the
best
towing
services
i
have
used
.

the
first
time
i
used
them
they
arrived
on
time
and
towed
car
for
me
to
the
destination
i
needed
.

the
auto
mechanics
that
work
for
auto
towing
are
very
friendly
and
informative
and
answered
any
question
i
had
.

they
have
towed
car
for
me
a
few
times
and
i
am
always
very
satisfied
with
this
services
.

if
you
are
looking
for
towing
services
that
can
offer
you
a
good
towed
car
service
,
then
auto
towing
is
the
company
for
you
.

a
very
satisfied
new
customer
!

as
a
very
satisfied
new
customer
,
i
wholeheartedly
recommend
united
air
duct
cleaning
.

they
are
professional
,
knowledgeable
,
and
take
meticulous
care
and
pride
in
accomplishing
their
work
.

not
only
were
my
wife
and
i
very
pleased
,
but
i
also
had
the
air
duct
quality
tested
professionally
by
the
home
inspector
that
i
regularly
use
,
before
and
after
united
air
duct
performed
their
work
.

based
on
the
test
results
,
the
home
inspector
stated
that
the
quality
of
their
job
was
"
excellent
"
.

the
best
breakfast
in
solana
beach
!

we
love
t
's
cafe
!

without
a
doubt
the
best
place
to
grab
a
tall
bloody
mary
and
some
eggs
benedict
.

t
's
has
been
a
north
county
landmark
for
thirty
years
and
with
good
reason
.

family
owned
and
operated
makes
sure
the
atmosphere
is
relaxed
and
the
food
home
-
cooked
with
style
.

i
highly
recommend
picking
up
a
jug
of
their
homemade
bloody
mary
mix
-
definitely
the
best
.

if
you
've
been
to
north
county
,
chances
are
it
's
in
your
favorites
list
already
.

prominent
builders
nj

prominent
builders
in
new
jersey
are
one
the
best
building
contractors
,
i
was
referred
to
them
by
my
friend
,
i
am
so
glad
i
used
them
for
my
home
renovation
,
and
addition
.

they
were
very
professional
,
respectful
,
completed
the
job
on
time
,
and
well
below
my
budget
.

mike
one
of
owners
was
awesome
,
he
explained
the
detailed
plan
,
and
executed
on
time
,
i
am
always
going
use
them
and
refer
them
to
many
friends
i
can
because
of
the
great
job
they
did
me
.

great
dude
cut
!

great
service
,
cool
vibe
,
impeccable
style
.

i
'm
a
guy
with
tricky
hair
so
getting
that
right
is
job
1
.

after
going
through
5
other
places
i
finally
found
janice
at
alta
moda
.

not
only
was
it
a
good
cut
but
my
wife
and
friends
comment
on
my
hair
every
time
i
leave
...
saying
it
's
the
best
look
i
've
ever
had
.

either
i
suck
at
my
own
style
or
janice
is
a
genius
.

looks
like
there
's
a
lot
of
talent
in
this
place
.

worth
every
penny
.

my
favorite
place
at
wildwood

i
have
been
going
to
the
wildwood
,
nj
for
over
30
years
for
summer
vacations
and
always
call
the
madrid
first
.

i
rated
it
5
stars
.

i
am
not
saying
it
is
a
5
star
hotel
.

i
am
saying
when
comparing
all
other
hotels
in
wildwood
,
this
hotel
has
everything
that
we
are
looking
for
.

it
is
the
hospitality
from
tom
and
staff
,
that
makes
it
feel
like
a
5
star
hotel
in
the
middle
of
the
beach
.

we
prefer
the
layout
of
rooms
and
it
is
always
clean
.

when
in
scordia
,
sicily

if
ever
in
sicily
please
take
the
time
to
visit
anna
maria
jose
mudo
and
her
familia
.

they
are
and
always
will
be
the
nicest
people
in
sicily
that
you
will
meet
.

you
will
also
have
the
pleasure
of
learning
the
italiano
language
.

you
will
also
have
the
experience
of
learning
the
bella
sicilian
culture
,
that
i
have
fallen
in
luv
with
.

i
will
4
-
ever
be
eternally
grateful
for
their
hospitality
and
luv
that
my
sicilian
family
showed
me
when
i
was
there
for
3
years
.

luv
always
..

i
've
never
felt
the
need
to
write
a
review
or
make
a
complaint
before
,
but
after
the
way
i
was
spoken
to
by
a
member
of
staff
at
the
kennels
(
whose
name
i
believe
to
be
mrs
closs
)
i
would
now
not
recommend
this
business
to
anybody
.

if
the
animals
are
treated
in
the
same
way
the
customers
are
treated
then
this
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
!

nobody
should
be
spoken
to
like
that
regardless
of
how
bad
their
day
may
have
been
or
what
may
be
going
on
in
their
private
lives
!

best
car
dealer
in
tx

i
purchased
a
nissan
from
this
dealship
.

the
sales
men
were
very
knowledgeable
about
every
aspect
of
every
car
we
looked
at
.

they
were
very
patient
and
helpful
from
showing
the
cars
to
doing
the
paperwork
.

the
paperwork
was
a
very
easy
and
smooth
.

they
tried
to
run
my
credit
score
as
less
as
possible
so
it
wo
n't
hurt
my
score
.

overall
,
i
was
very
happy
with
the
customer
service
and
my
purchase
.

if
you
're
looking
to
buy
a
car
,
definitely
give
them
a
call
.

they
have
a
huge
inventory
.

i
have
been
a
patient
a
nw
hospital
and
it
was
great
.

i
have
also
had
an
80
yr
old
that
i
take
of
sent
to
the
er
and
long
stays
in
the
hospital
.

yes
,
we
had
to
wait
,
but
er
is
a
triage
system
that
takes
the
most
life
threatening
cases
first
.

any
er
would
be
the
same
.

as
far
as
being
treated
like
a
drug
seeker
,
that
has
not
been
my
experience
.

as
a
nurse
i
know
about
drug
seekers
.

this
is
a
great
hospital
and
even
better
since
it
became
part
of
the
uw
system
.

wonderful
experience

i
had
immense
pain
on
a
sunday
morning
,
with
friends
and
family
telling
me
that
i
would
never
find
a
dentist
on
a
sunday
.

dr.
taylor
was
not
only
available
on
a
sunday
,
but
also
was
able
to
immediately
take
care
of
me
.

he
was
incredibly
informative
about
the
options
i
had
,
giving
me
opinions
on
different
treatments
to
choose
from
.

coming
from
a
person
who
hates
the
dentist
in
general
,
dr.
taylor
was
the
best
!

he
really
made
the
visit
a
pain
free
one
with
excellent
service
!

i
would
recommend
him
to
everyone
!

horrible

this
school
is
the
worst
one
i
've
ever
been
to
.

i
attended
it
for
2
years
,
and
that
was
enough
.

there
's
holes
everywhere
in
the
ceiling
,
sewage
constantly
leaks
through
the
ceiling
,
and
the
whole
condition
of
the
school
is
horrible
.

the
staff
and
the
principal
are
rediculous
,
they
do
n't
listen
to
any
input
,
and
they
make
up
rediculous
rules
(
they
banned
backpacks
,
because
a
teacher
tripped
over
a
student
's
)
.

the
education
is
horrible
at
best
,
do
society
a
favor
,
and
do
not
send
your
student
here
.

excellent
customer
service
and
quality
work
.

they
went
the
extra
mile
to
repair
my
cowboy
boots
--
they
had
to
have
a
special
kind
of
paper
that
looked
like
wood
grain
to
fix
the
heels
.

that
was
4
years
ago
.

i
have
n't
been
able
to
find
a
shoe
repair
place
in
seattle
since
that
has
been
able
to
do
it
.

(
i
've
been
through
at
least
5
places
already
.
)

if
i
had
time
to
drive
to
tacoma
before
they
closed
during
the
work
week
,
i
would
just
so
i
could
get
those
boots
fixed
properly
again
.

so
handy
for
local
la
jolla
stuff
-
especially
for
finding
residential
numbers

since
moving
back
from
college
and
trying
to
settle
roots
in
the
village
,
i
have
referred
to
the
la
jolla
blue
book
for
a
ton
of
local
numbers
.

the
white
pages
allowed
me
to
get
in
touch
with
parents
of
my
high
school
friends
so
that
i
could
track
people
down
one
by
one
and
the
restaurant
section
is
basically
my
cookbook
.

it
's
really
cool
that
so
many
local
businesses
are
found
so
quickly
in
one
place
and
i
want
to
spread
the
word
.

thx
:-)

the
staff
do
occasionally
get
game
info
correct
,
but
if
you
r
looking
fot
a
good
game
and
are
n't
a
nerd
,
do
nt
ask
them
.

the
last
time
i
did
that
i
was
suggested
to
buy
oblivion
when
i
told
them
i
was
looking
for
a
fps
.

i
knew
what
it
was
and
told
the
guy
that
it
was
n't
a
fps
.

he
tried
to
tell
me
it
was
when
i
told
asked
him
if
he
knew
what
fps
stood
for
and
he
had
no
clue
.

overall
they
are
n't
very
knowledge
about
the
type
of
games
are
on
the
market
.

first
and
last
time
we
'll
eat
there

my
friend
and
i
went
there
for
lunch
today
.

neither
one
of
us
had
ever
been
-
so
we
thought
we
'd
try
it
.

big
mistake
-
the
food
was
tasteless
and
cold
.

we
both
kept
trying
to
find
something
we
liked
.

the
only
thing
i
found
edible
were
the
potato
wedges
,
i
finally
gave
up
,
he
kept
trying
-
he
found
the
fried
wantons
to
be
ok
-
his
mongolian
bowl
was
awful
.

would
not
recommend
this
place
to
anyone
-
in
fact
-
save
your
money
and
go
somewhere
else
.

liquidweb.com
rocks
!!!

i
am
not
a
client
of
liquidweb.com
,
but
one
of
my
friend
called
steven
is
the
client
having
several
websites
.

i
work
with
him
and
since
past
6
years
he
is
hosting
his
websites
to
liquidweb
.

as
i
have
gone
through
many
reviews
sites
to
see
if
any
provider
is
providing
better
services
or
not
,
and
i
have
realized
that
there
were
many
good
reviews
about
liquidweb
also
steven
never
faced
any
server
issues
in
his
whole
hosting
.

the
kind
of
support
they
provide
is
simply
great
!!!

i
would
like
to
host
my
upcoming
website
to
liquidweb.com

simple

perfect

if
you
want
flashy
fancy
food
stacked
high
with
lots
of
fussy
garnishes
,
this
is
not
the
place
for
you
.

if
you

a

exquisite
ingredients
,

hands
-
down
the
best
pasta
and
gnocchi
i
've
ever
eaten
(
and
i
've
eaten
a
lot
)
.

the
antipasti
were
amazing
,
the
wines
were
mind
-
blowing
,
the
service
could
n't
have
been
better
.

i
've
dined
at
lots
of
high
-
end
restaurants
and
i
've
never
before
felt
my
money
was
so
well
spent
.

great
prices
,
great
service
!

i
've
been
to
this
shop
twice
(
once
for
an
inspection
and
again
for
an
oil
change
)
and
they
truly
live
up
to
their
name
:
discount
!

they
have
all
kind
of
coupons
available
for
car
washes
,
oil
changes
,
state
inspection
,
etc
.

the
thing
is
,
you
still
get
high
quality
service
at
nicely
discounted
rates
!

there
is
even
free
coffee
and
bottles
of
water
if
you
'd
like
.

the
owner
is
a
pleasant
guy
and
i
would
trust
my
car
with
him
or
any
of
his
workers
.

top
notch
,
all
the
way

david
is
amazing

david
is
the
most
helpful
and
creative
photographer
that
i
have
used
.

he
is
willing
to
do
whatever
you
need
from
him
without
hesitation
.

he
was
patient
and
adapted
when
everything
did
n't
go
according
to
schedule
on
my
wedding
day
.

both
the
engagement
and
wedding
pictures
that
he
took
for
us
we
absolutely
amazing
.

he
got
the
pictures
back
to
me
quickly
.

i
would
highly
recommend
david
to
anyone
.

he
will
exceed
your
expectations
!

he
does
n't
just
take
pictures
he
makes
art
out
of
them
and
you
wo
n't
even
notice
that
there
's
a
camera
there
.

not
so
great

my
husband
just
got
a
bike
there
as
a
gift
he
's
only
had
it
a
month
.

it
's
a
nice
bike
and
it
cost
a
lot
of
money
.

but
just
this
week
a
peddle
broke
.

he
took
it
back
and
they
would
not
honor
a
warranty
and
said
it
was
his
fault
because
of
his
shoes
??

so
they
were
going
to
charge
him
for
new
peddles
and
proceeded
to
put
them
on
without
even
telling
him
the
price
.

which
was
very
expensive
.

he
asked
for
a
different
pair
instead
and
they
only
gave
him
five
dollars
off
??

trek
is
not
so
great

only
concerned
with
money

i
have
been
getting
my
treatments
for
a
few
months
now
and
have
seen
some
results
but
not
up
to
the
standards
that
i
was
told
i
should
expect
.

the
people
there
attempt
to
come
across
and
professional
and
nice
,
but
i
was
disappointed
with
their
customer
service
.

never
miss
an
appointment
because
they
will
charge
you
the
price
of
a
treatment
,
even
if
you
had
an
emergency
.

it
's
pretty
ridiculous
!

they
want
to
squeeze
as
much
as
they
can
from
you
even
if
you
just
got
in
a
car
accident
!!!!

they
do
n't
care
one
bit
about
you
!!!!!

terrible
service
!!!

made
an
appointment
to
have
them
come
to
the
house
to
discuss
curtain
options
and
give
an
estimate
.

they
sent
over
someone
who
said
he
knows
nothing
about
curtains
and
could
not
show
me
fabric
options
or
give
an
estimate
.

when
i
called
the
manager
to
complain
,
she
said
she
knew
the
guy
did
n't
know
about
curtains
and
that
the
usual
lady
called
in
sick
hours
earlier
!

instead
of
rescheduling
they
chose
to
waste
my
time
instead
.

so
what
was
the
point
of
the
appointment
!?!

to
just
come
over
and
hang
out
?!?

i
will
never
do
business
with
this
company
!

ever
!!!

internet
department
is
rude
and
insulting

i
was
looking
to
bring
a
customer
to
their
lot
to
buy
a
car
but
the
internet
salesperson
last
name
is
balazick
sent
me
this
email
"
and
if
it
was
worth
my
time
i
would
of
bothered
aswering
your
questions
.

i
make
money
not
deal
with
brokers
"
wow
,
can
you
believe
in
today
s
tough
times
this
dealership
would
be
looking
for
any
way
to
move
vehicles
.

as
a
previous
internet
manager
i
would
deal
with
anyone
looking
to
buy
a
car
for
a
profit
and
not
care
if
they
came
in
with
a
broker
.

stay
away
from
this
dealership
!!!

this
place
is
a
rip
-
off

i
brought
a
car
in
to
have
the
"
check
engine
"
light
diagnosed
back
in
march
of
2010
.

they
said
it
was
"
plugs
and
wires
"
and
quoted
me
$
330
to
do
the
work
,
including
parts
.

i
asked
why
so
high
and
they
said
it
was
due
to
the
labor
of
moving
things
out
of
the
way
.

those
things
ended
up
being
a
windsheild
washer
fluid
tank
(
1
screw
)
and
the
air
filter
canister
(
4
spring
clips
)
.

i
did
the
work
myself
for
$
50
.

there
's
no
excuse
for
that
kind
of
estimate
.

my
girlfriend
and
i
took
a
chance
on
this
place
because
we
did
n't
want
to
wait
in
line
at
outback
.

what
an
amazing
find
-
this
restaurant
is
a
gem
.

1
it
s
immaculately
clean
.

2
the
decor
is
tasteful
and
artistic
,
from
the
comfortable
chairs
to
the
elegant
light
fixtures
....
and
(
most
importantly
)
3
the
food
is
fantastic
.

this
is
authentic
cuban
cuisine
;
fresh
ingredients
expertly
prepared
and
seasoned
perfectly
.

the
portions
were
generous
and
we
got
out
for
less
than
the
cost
of
one
entree
at
some
chain
restaurant
.

try
this
place
-
you
'll
love
it
.

thank
you
for
helping
me
get
more
healthy
!

i
came
in
and
saw
dr.
ruona
about
a
month
ago
for
quitting
smoking
.

i
have
to
tell
you
that
i
have
n't
had
one
and
do
n't
want
one
.

it
is
the
easiest
thing
that
i
have
ever
done
and
i
tell
all
my
friends
that
they
should
do
it
too
.

i
sent
a
customer
of
mine
to
you
.

dr.
ruona
,
if
you
read
this
,
thank
you
for
helping
me
get
more
healthy
.

i
feel
lighter
and
feel
that
i
have
more
possibilities
open
to
me
now
than
i
did
before
.

i
ca
n't
thank
you
enough
.

fantastic
for
kids

if
you
have
children
or
are
just
a
real
animal
lover
yourself
you
'll
love
this
zoo
.

it
's
only
$
10
and
in
essence
just
one
big
petting
zoo
.

they
sell
feed
and
milk
bottles
at
the
front
and
i
recommend
you
buy
lots
.

we
took
our
7
month
old
and
she
laughed
and
giggled
when
(
very
harshly
i
might
add
)
grabbing
and
'
kissed
'
the
goats
and
lambs
.

the
animals
were
all
very
sweet
and
patient
with
her
.

among
the
animals
that
were
available
to
touch
were
pony's
,
camels
and
even
an
ostrich
!!!

wonderful
,
inexpensive
and
lots
of
fun
!

wow
!!!

i
ca
n't
say
enough
good
things
about
karla
and
the
wonderful
things
she
has
done
for
me
and
my
dog
gracee
.

gracee
is
more
excited
to
see
her
than
she
is
to
see
me
!!!!

she
has
always
been
there
for
gracee
even
for
last
minute
calls
!

she
has
taken
care
of
my
sweet
girl
for
almost
4
years
now
and
i
would
not
let
gracee
go
with
anyone
besides
her
!!!

she
is
caring
,
punctual
,
and
very
enthusiastic
about
her
job
!

you
should
give
her
a
try
-
it
's
worth
every
penny
to
know
that
you
pet
is
in
great
hands
with
wunderbar
pet
sitting
!!!!

worst
service
i
've
ever
experienced

i
wish
there
was
something
good
to
say
about
the
business
,
but
unfortunately
,
there
is
n't
.

1
)
service
and
manners
were
nonexistent
.

2
)
the
employees
constantly
talk
down
to
customers
and
are
very
argumentative
for
the
sake
of
being
argumentative
.

(
to
both
myself
and
customers
)
3
)
i
have
never
experienced
so
much
rudeness
coming
from
a
business
.

4
)
the
business
is
very
unorganized
.

the
invoice
is
not
detailed
,
so
it
is
difficult
to
see
what
you
are
paying
for
.

i
'd
recommend
to
save
your
time
and
energy
and
find
another
greek
store
.

the
best
!!!

exile
is
the
longest
lasting
and
most
authentic
punk
store
in
richmond
!

i
have
been
shopping
there
for
over
six
years
now
.

the
staff
is
incredibly
friendly
and
helpful
and
the
owner
,
mimmy
,
is
an
absolute
angel
.

the
mark
up
is
minimal
considering
that
the
clothing
is
hard
to
find
and
often
shipped
for
europe
.

in
addition
,
the
clothing
is
of
much
better
quality
than
the
clothing
from
hot
topic
,
which
is
made
as
cheaply
as
possible
by
people
living
in
horrible
conditions
in
asia
.

exile
is
environmentally
conscious
and
involved
heavily
in
our
community
.

over-rated

buddakan
inevitably
attracts
the
majority
of
its
guests
simply
because
of
its
association
with
steven
starr
,
but
that
does
n't
impress
me
.

the
atmosphere
alone
deserves
4
stars
but
,
the
food
was
not
up
to
par
with
the
price
tag
and
the
reputation
the
restaurant
carries
.

the
server
we
had
was
knowledgeable
but
he
was
not
as
proper
as
he
should
have
been
,
acting
like
he
was
talking
to
his
friends
rather
than
his
customers
.

the
angry
lobster
was
completely
over-priced
!

$
80
for
a
dish
that
has
about
one
small
lobster
tail
and
is
full
of
filler
vegetables
!

i
would
n't
go
there
again
.

alto
delivers
on
all
levels
.

from
the
moment
you
enter
the
restaurant
,
you
know
you
are
some
place
special
.

the
service
is
impeccable
,
and
the
food
is
even
better
.

i
highly
recommend
the
four
-
course
tasting
menu
,
which
gives
you
plenty
of
range
and
food
to
satisfy
your
appetite
.

also
,
if
you
are
into
wine
,
alto
has
the
depth
of
both
region
,
varietal
,
and
vintage
to
satisfy
nearly
any
sommelier
(
or
after
9
pm
,
bring
your
own
bottle
for
free
...
no
corking
fee
!
)
.

while
it
's
not
cheap
,
alto
will
give
you
an
experience
you
'll
never
forget
.

the
landlord
is
not
nice
nor
helpful

i
have
lived
in
buckingham
condominiums
townhouse
for
2
years
.

i
love
the
location
and
the
apartment
!!

i
'm
a
single
female
and
i
feel
safe
coming
home
at
night
.

the
maintenance
people
are
awesome
!!!!

and
the
exterminator
is
very
nice
,
also
.

yes
,
you
still
have
a
few
bugs
,
but
that
's
going
to
be
anywhere
you
go
!

the
only
problem
that
i
have
experienced
is
the
landlord
.

she
is
a
pure
b****
!!!

i
know
that
's
ugly
...
but
she
wo
n't
help
you
out
for
anything
...
sad
story
.

other
than
that
,
i
would
recommend
living
here
.
:)

the
staff
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
.

the
front
staff
has
seen
quite
a
bit
of
turnover
and
changed
from
professional
to
rude
.

a
simple
follow
-
up
phone
call
with
a
woman
quickly
turned
into
a
nightmare
.

she
may
be
the
reason
for
all
the
change
.

i
sincerely
wonder
if
the
doctor
has
a
clue
about
what
is
going
on
within
his
practice
.

if
he
does
know
and
approves
of
this
behavior
then
it
is
a
poor
reflection
on
him
.

sometimes
it
is
not
worth
it
to
go
through
that
kind
of
staff
and
their
personal
attitude
to
get
to
a
doctor
.

he
was
an
okay
doctor
but
not
worth
her
.

wonderful
wild
wildernest
inn

i
would
give
the
wildernest
inn
ten
stars
of
five
!

atop
spring
mountain
,
from
the
decks
of
the
west
porch
,
"
one
can
see
forever
"
a
scene
of
unparalleled
beauty
and
grandeur
.

i
saw
deer
frequently
,
in
fact
a
small
herd
were
grazing
near
the
lodge
.

there
were
occasional
bears
on
the
deck
in
the
morning
.

and
most
correctly
,
us
visitors
did
not
mingle
with
the
native
wildlife
.

it
would
have
been
more
than
one
could
bear
!

kathy
and
stewart
,
the
proprietors
were
the
epitome
of
perfection
.

delightful
,
hospitable
,
superb
,
cozy
and
comfortable
.

i
hope
to
be
back
!

junkie
lube
?!

really
weird
place
,
i
was
driving
home
from
work
thought
i
'd
stop
in
for
an
oil
change
and
well
,
there
are
a
few
guys
in
jiffy
lube
uniforms
sitting
at
the
table
drinking
beers
and
shooting
the
breeze
.

the
neon
lighting
sign
still
said
"
on
"
yet
some
guy
who
seemed
to
be
the
oldest
of
the
bunch
,
more
like
the
drunkest
of
the
bunch
told
me
they
'd
be
open
tomorrow
.

i
asked
if
a
manager
was
on
duty
he
told
me
he
was
.

wow
!

grey
shirt
"
mark
"
of
course
with
this
type
behavior
he
could
have
been
wearing
someon
else
s
clothing
.....

a
friend
and
i
recently
took
our
16
and
18
month
olds
here
.

while
there
was
n't
too
much
available
for
their
age
(
ball
pit
,
bouncy
area
and
a
little
padded
pyramid
to
climb
on
)
,
we
went
right
when
they
opened
at
10
am
on
a
winter
weekday
and
ended
up
being
the
only
ones
there
,
so
we
were
given
a
little
more
liberty
than
we
would
have
if
others
had
been
there
.

it
's
not
the
classiest
place
,
but
it
was
cleaner
than
i
expected
and
the
staff
was
very
friendly
.

for
$
4
it
was
a
nice
break
from
the
monotony
of
winter
indoors
with
a
toddler
.

restored
my
faith
in
mechaincs
.

i
spent
3
months
going
from
shop
to
shop
trying
to
get
my
ferrari
to
run
and
drive
the
way
it
should
.

i
was
about
to
give
up
when
i
met
jason
and
neal
.

they
took
on
the
challenge
of
making
my
ferrari
all
i
dreamed
of
and
more
.

the
crew
at
the
creative
workshop
went
over
and
above
the
call
of
duty
and
gave
me
back
a
car
i
can
drive
anywhere
and
finally
enjoy
owning
.

i
can
not
say
enough
about
this
place
.

they
have
restored
my
faith
in
mechanics
.

do
yourself
a
favor
,
call
these
guys
first
and
enjoy
driving
your
car
again
..

a
great
vacation
!

we
wanted
to
see
the
sun
-
and
we
also
got
much
more
!

excellent
chefs
are
in
the
kitchen
preparing
memorable
breakfasts
.

after
a
train
ride
over
the
mountains
,
we
enjoyed
hiking
in
the
flower
-
filled
wenatchee
hills
(
in
may
)
and
a
very
interesting
bike
ride
in
a
loop
around
the
columbia
river
...
and
then
wine
if
we
wanted
it
on
the
patio
in
the
evening
....

this
is
a
busy
group
of
hosts
they
are
also
running
a
restaurant
,
which
also
must
be
wonderful
-
so
just
ask
for
what
you
need
,
and
i
'm
sure
they
will
do
their
best
to
be
hospitable
.

omg

omg
..
make
sure
to
book
a
reservation
,
as
this
magical
place
is
packed
(
in
a
nice
way
)
i
love
that
the
owner
walks
around
and
cares
how
his
customers
feel
about
their
food
.

the
waiters
are
like
no
other
...

my
waiter
was
so
excellent
i
gave
him
a
75
%
tip
,
and
it
was
worht
every
penny
..

the
food
was
finger
licking
the
bowel
fantastic
..

i
just
discovered
her
has
a
place
right
near
my
work
(
color
me
phat
)
if
you
are
looking
for
a
romatic
place
with
the
best
food
and
service
in
the
valley
giovanni
ristorante
should
be
your
number
1
+
2
choice
.

holly
is
truely
the
best
hairstylist
!

i
have
lived
in
the
utc
la
jolla
area
for
many
years
,
and
i
never
new
this
salon
was
here
until
a
friend
reffered
me
to
see
holly
here
.

i
was
very
pleased
with
my
experience
here
.

all
of
the
people
were
friendly
and
welcoming
.

i
got
highlights
,
haircut
,
and
a
blowdry
.

she
did
a
great
job
!

holly
is
very
experienced
and
talented
,
and
i
could
tell
she
new
what
she
was
doing
right
off
the
bat
.

my
hair
looks
amazing
,
and
i
get
compliments
all
the
time
.

i
deffenitly
reccomend
this
salon
and
holly
to
anyone
.

you
will
not
be
disappointed
!!!!!!

outdated
but
not
bad

so
i
really
felt
like
this
place
was
extremely
outdated
especially
since
the
pictures
make
it
look
nice
and
modern
.

it
had
listed
that
there
was
a
hot
breakfast
but
all
this
meant
is
that
they
added
a
waffle
maker
to
the
common
continental
affair
at
most
cheap
hotels
.

the
family
suite
was
basically
two
rooms
with
a
small
opening
between
them
which
worked
great
for
us
because
we
were
two
families
traveling
together
.

if
you
are
in
town
and
need
that
kind
of
space
i
say
stay
here
but
if
you
are
looking
for
a
little
more
upscale
affair
do
n't
let
the
pictures
fool
you
and
book
somewhere
else
.

great
,
and
probably
the
only
west
indian
spot
worth
hitting
up
in
nashville
.

i
was
born
and
raised
in
toronto
,
which
has
a
huge
west
indian
(
trinidadian
,
jamaican
,
etc
)
population
.

so
huge
in
fact
,
that
toronto
slang
is
influenced
by
and
has
jamaican
references
,
and
jamaican
beef
patties
are
staples
in
my
high
school
cafeteria
.

anyway
,
i
was
practically
raised
on
this
stuff
,
and
being
a
connoisseur
of
west
indian
cuisine
,
jamaica
way
is
a
bit
toned
down
to
suit
the
american
palette
.

all
you
have
to
do
to
make
it
authentic
jamaican
food
,
is
add
a
whole
lot
of
pepper
.

a
lot
.

the
finest
christmas
trees
i
've
ever
seen
.

i
felt
like
i
was
in
heaven
when
i
walked
through
the
majestic
fields
of
this
particular
farm
.

the
trees
were
in
magnificent
shape
and
the
variety
was
astounding
.

the
owners
were
entertaining
and
gracious
.

i
especially
liked
the
eco
friendly
atmosphere
and
the
owner
s
love
of
all
animals
.

this
is
one
of
the
best
farms
i
have
ever
been
too
.

i
would
call
it
the
taj
mahal
of
the
east
coast
!

it
put
hair
on
my
chest
and
thanks
to
the
owner
s
advice
i
invested
vanguard
,
got
myself
a
woman
like
jerry
,
and
became
a
republican
.

thanks

pho
-
nomenal
!!

i
have
been
eating
pho
for
almost
my
entire
life
and
i
've
always
gone
to
the
pho
places
in
south
philly
and
off
the
boulevard
and
even
the
other
one
in
chinatown
,
but
when
i
tried
this
pho
place
,
it
blew
the
other
pho
houses
away
!!

all
of
the
pho
places
taste
the
same
to
me
,
so
what
seperates
one
from
the
other
is
the
service
and
the
price
.

the
service
here
is
incredible
compared
to
the
other
places
.

the
only
down
fall
of
this
pho
house
is
the
difficulty
in
finding
parking
in
chinatown
.

remember
to
bring
cash
since
they
do
n't
take
debit
or
credit
.

hope
this
helps
!!

had
a
horrible
experience
with
a
manager
here
,
rachel
mcinnis
,
she
was
rude
,
inconsiderate
and
did
not
do
the
right
thing
for
an
item
that
was
marked
incorrectly
...

i
'm
not
interested
in
shopping
in
a
place
with
people
like
her
...
she
refused
to
sell
me
the
item
at
its
marked
price
even
after
admitting
they
had
made
a
mistake
.

i
normally
do
n't
write
reviews
but
seeing
that
i
considered
dillards
a
distinguished
,
upscale
place
to
shop
,
this
one
wo
n't
be
getting
my
business
,
nor
my
family
's
,
nor
my
co-workers
.

it
's
never
ok
to
let
a
customer
walk
out
unhappy
,
especially
when
they
are
right
.

highly
recommend

i
work
as
a
transformational
life
coach
.

since
this
is
an
alternative
therapy
i
always
refer
clients
to
a
lisenced
therapist
when
i
feel
that
is
appropriate
.

i
found
her
through
a
colleague
one
day
when
one
of
my
clients
was
in
the
midst
of
a
panic
attack
and
needed
professional
help
that
i
am
not
qualified
to
provide
.

little
did
i
know
that
i
would
soon
be
needing
her
help
as
well
!

she
guided
me
through
a
very
difficult
period
dealing
with
a
family
member
's
suicide
,
coupled
with
elder
abuse
.

i
found
her
to
be
extremely
solid
,
kind
,
compassionate
,
and
intuitive
as
well
.

i
would
recommend
her
highly
!

they
wo
n't
have
a
second
chance
from
me
.

first
,
let
me
state
that
although
i
live
in
nyc
,
i
am
not
from
nyc
,
i
do
n't
care
about
baseball
and
i
absolutely
love
boston
to
death
(
so
beautiful
,
so
clean
,
so
awesome
)
.

that
said
,
i
hated
this
restaurant
.

the
service
was
just
about
as
good
as
i
'd
get
in
nyc
(
that
means
it
was
poor
)
and
the
food
was
almost
mediocre
.

the
decor
left
a
lot
to
be
desired
and
the
posters
telling
me
all
the
reasons
99
was
great
just
served
as
an
ironic
contrast
against
the
reality
.

personally
i
recommend
you
take
your
money
elsewhere

when
i
arrived
at
brickell
honda
on
6/4/11
,
i
was
greeted
and
attended
to
by
the
sales
manager
,
gustavo
guerra
,
in
a
very
friendly
and
professional
manner
.

i
explained
to
him
what
i
wanted
and
that
i
previously
went
to
braman
honda
.

bramen
honda
was
a
bit
of
a
hassle
.

he
told
me
"
no
problem
,
we
will
match
the
offer
or
do
better
.
"

mr.
guerra
gave
me
a
better
deal
without
any
hassles
nor
any
type
of
problems
.

brickell
honda
has
been
the
best
buying
experience
in
the
world
.

i
urge
all
st.
thomas
the
apostle
parishioners
and
all
of
south
florida
residents
to
come
see
gus
!!!

excellent
customer
service
!!!

great
,
honest
service

i
took
my
2001
nissan
frontier
in
to
fix
a
cracked
manifold
.

the
dealer
wanted
$
1300
to
fix
that
and
another
$
1500
to
fix
some
other
things
.

eagle
transmission
determined
that
much
of
the
work
the
dealer
said
needed
to
be
done
was
unneccesary
and
what
needed
to
be
fixed
was
only
$
400
!!

i
was
so
impressed
with
the
honesty
and
integrity
of
mike
and
everyone
at
eagle
transmission
!

i
dropped
the
truck
off
in
the
morning
and
it
was
ready
that
afternoon
.

i
have
finally
found
a
mechanic
i
trust
!!

and
it
was
great
that
they
did
not
charge
a
service
fee
to
diagnose
the
problem
-
an
added
bonus
!!

dr.

ghassemlou
.

during
the
session
,
he
demanded
to
have
my
physical
address
,
which
i
've
always
kept
private
as
i
am
enrolled
in
a
witness
protection
program
.

i
believe
he
is
correct
in
that
he
needs
my
physical
address
for
legal
reasons
,
however
,
he
did
not
adequately
explain
this
during
our
session
.

i
learned
more
about
this
doing
my
own
research
afterward
.

i
think
he
could
've
done
more
to
assuage
my
concerns
by
giving
me
concrete
facts
.

saying
that
i
need
to
give
him
my
address
or
else
i
have
intimacy
issues
is
not
helpful
.

it
's
pretty
combative
actually
.

you
'll
love
it

i
have
had
my
back
fused
in
2
places
.

i
wish
that
i
had
n't
done
this
.

with
these
fusions
,
chiropractric
is
n't
as
successful
,
but
it
still
is
very
helpful
.

even
after
my
fusions
,
my
back
continued
to
hurt
,
but
now
it
does
n't
hurt
any
more
.

i
would
encourage
anyone
who
is
thinking
of
back
surgery
,
to
talk
about
different
treatment
options
first
with
dr.
de
barros
.

he
really
knows
what
he
is
talking
about
and
will
approach
the
different
options
fairly
.

you
can
see
different
treatments
that
a
surgeon
ca
n't
see
,
so
that
you
can
have
several
treatment
options
before
you
decide
what
to
do
.

unbelievably
huge
experience
for
such
a
small
salon
!!!

i
have
been
to
kim
at
cheveux
for
more
than
five
years
.

i
can
not
tell
you
how
often
i
am
complimented
on
my
hair
(
style
and
color
)
!

i
regularly
request
kim
's
business
cards
as
i
am
often
stopped
on
the
street
and
asked
"
who
does
your
hair
...
i
love
it
!!!
"

quaint
,
lovely
,
small
salon
with
big
personality
.

i
am
made
to
feel
special
when
i
am
in
the
chair
and
i
have
never
had
a
less
than
amazing
cut
or
color
experience
.

my
hair
has
never
felt
this
healthy
,
either
.

i
can
not
recommend
this
salon
enough
!!!

thanks
cheveux
!

my
favorite
in
mclean

my
family
loves
coming
to
endo
sushi
.
they
are
very
nice
,
it
is
never
crowded
,
and
the
food
is
wonderful
,
very
delicious
and
fresh
!

sometimes
it
is
hard
to
get
parking
in
the
lot
in
front
of
the
storefront
,
and
it
is
on
a
one
-
way
street
,
but
the
restaurant
itself
is
never
overcrowded
.

if
you
can
not
park
in
the
lot
,
then
you
can
park
in
the
shopping
center
's
garage
,
and
walk
up
to
endo
sushi
.

the
service
is
fast
.

be
sure
to
ring
the
little
bell
on
your
way
out
if
you
enjoyed
your
meal
!

(
it
's
by
the
door
,
on
the
hostess
stand
)

horrible
service
!

i
got
yelled
at
,
literally
yelled
at
because
i
asked
if
i
could
pick
up
my
car
5
-
10
minutes
late
.

i
explained
that
i
was
already
on
my
way
and
i
would
rush
to
get
there
as
soon
as
i
could
because
i
needed
my
car
for
work
at
5
am
,
but
the
guy
was
arguing
with
me
saying
he
was
gon
na
lock
the
doors
right
at
5:30
.

rude
,
unprofessional
,
just
jerks
.

seems
like
all
they
care
about
is
the
money
and
getting
home
on
time
,
no
care
for
the
customers
at
all
!!!

missed
a
whole
day
of
work
because
i
am
now
carless
.

i
will
neeeeeeeeeverrrr
go
to
this
place
again
.

superb
arrangements

i
used
fancy
flowers
for
my
late
husband
's
funeral
flowers
as
they
had
been
recommended
to
me
.

i
am
so
glad
that
i
called
in
to
see
ana
,
she
is
a
lovely
girl
who
showed
nothing
but
care
and
compassion
towards
me
.

the
flowers
were
all
that
i
hoped
they
would
be
,
i
have
attended
several
funerals
of
late
unfortunately
and
the
flowers
i
recieved
from
ana
outshone
them
all
.

she
is
so
talented
,
the
flowers
were
arranged
superbly
and
delicately
,
it
is
so
obvious
to
see
the
difference
between
someone
fully
trained
and
skilled
compared
to
others
.

thank
you
ana
i
hope
to
see
you
in
the
future
under
better
circumstances
.

great
first
experience
.

i
'm
22
,
and
my
hairdresser
was
great
(
and
not
"
old
"
like
one
of
the
reviews
says
)
-
she
really
listened
to
what
i
wanted
and
gave
me
tons
of
tips
on
how
to
style
my
hair
so
i
could
get
it
to
look
the
way
i
wanted
it
to
.

she
deep
conditioned
my
hair
and
took
the
time
to
style
it
properly
.

she
recommended
products
but
absolutely
did
n't
pressure
me
to
buy
.

it
's
a
cute
place
with
a
really
friendly
,
laid
-
back
atmosphere
.

i
would
highly
recommend
it
and
will
be
going
back
for
my
next
haircut
.

oh
!

and
students
get
$
5
off
,
ca
n't
argue
with
that
.

smoker
s
haven

yeah
,
this
complex
is
not
very
good
.

our
bathroom
fan
,
one
electric
outlet
and
2
leaky
sinks
have
yet
to
be
fixed
.

both
bathrooms
look
like
they
were
flooded
and
the
wood
cabinets
are
thrashed
at
the
bottom
and
they
slapped
some
pieces
of
wood
over
to
try
to
cover
it
up
.

and
non-smokers
beware
!!!

i
think
90
percent
of
the
tenants
are
smokers
!

if
you
do
not
smoke
,
do
not
move
here
.

our
unit
reeks
of
old
cigarette
smoke
and
it
started
to
become
apparent
a
few
weeks
after
we
moved
in
.

you
can
not
walk
5
feet
without
smelling
that
disgusting
cigarette
smoke
and
it
blows
right
into
the
windows
all
day
and
all
night
.

great
sanwiches
,
great
prices

i
used
to
go
here
almost
every
day
since
i
work
in
the
neighbourhood
and
loved
their
turkey
and
meatball
sandwiches
.

chicken
salad
salad
is
great
too
.

best
of
all
,
the
staff
is
quick
on
their
feet
and
even
with
long
lines
,
usually
serve
you
in
5
minutes
or
less
.

for
the
quality
,
the
prices
(
$
4
-
$
6
)
have
to
be
the
best
in
town
.

the
staff
get
to
know
regulars
and
do
their
job
very
well
.

tourists
like
the
other
reviewer
might
not
appreciate
their
efficiency
or
quality
,
but
i
certainly
do
.

this
is
n't
a
tgif
or
cafe
,
it
s
a
lunch
sandwich
place
and
a
good
one
at
that
.

rate
a
church
?

might
as
well
just
hotpot
the
curb
and
rate
the
traffic
light
.

it
's
a
bloody
church
,
for
chrisssake
!

big
,
grey
and
imposing
.

go
there
on
christian
holidays
for
a
bit
of
churchy
grandure
.

the
pastor
at
this
church
is
cool
,
i
met
him
after
some
holiday
service
.

he
had
a
robe
that
was
made
back
in
the
'60s
.

god
was
pleased
with
that
one
!

it
's
historical
for
sf
,
so
when
your
aunte
comes
for
a
visit
,
take
her
there
.

great
for
the
kiddies
-
they
love
the
labyrinth
(
do
n't
forget
to
tell
'em
it
s
really
a
'
pagen
'
thing
!
)
.

stop
by
at
least
once
or
you
'll
go
to
heck
!

ok
but
just
becuse
we
where
on
a
tight
budget
.

me
and
my
dad
where
in
nj
for
a
kc
chiefs
(
my
home
team
)
vs
the
ny
jets
and
for
game
4
of
the
world
series
.

i
'm
a
red
sox
fan
so
i
was
glad
that
the
phillies
won
.

the
knights
inn
was
small
very
small
.
i
mean
1
room
in
every
room
!
it
was
cozy
a
little
and
a
small
tv
.

i
mean
a
2
day
stay
was
a
ok
stay
even
tho
the
manager
looked
like
he
was
chineze
and
that
we
only
slept
and
went
out
from
8
to
7
to
see
new
york
.

but
sice
we
almost
just
slept
there
i
ca
nt
give
that
good
of
a
review

it
was
a
saturday
and
my
spring
was
broken
...

i
googled
garage
door
repair
in
woodinville
and
found
ndi
-
johnette
answered
the
phone
and
was
oh
-
so
pleasant
and
helpful
!

she
sort
of
appologized
for
dan
taking
the
day
off
to
go
skiing
-
but
he
could
do
the
repair
on
sunday
!

i
said
great
and
dan
arrived
on
time
at
10
am
to
make
the
repair
.

i
enjoyed
speaking
with
dan
,
and
learning
more
about
how
the
springs
are
sized
for
these
doors
.

the
repair
went
quickly
and
the
price
was
extremely
fair
.

i
would
highly
recommend
ndi
-
and
will
spread
the
word
to
my
neighbors
.

thanks
dan
and
johnette
for
your
responsiveness
and
professional
service
.

roger
m.
,
woodinville

i
would
n't
send
my
dogs
there
.

i
had
a
conversation
with
the
woman
running
this
place
in
april
2010
.

she
basically
said
if
the
children
getting
off
the
bus
are
n't
paying
to
enter
her
building
she
was
going
to
let
them
wander
around
the
streets
.

wow
,
really
?

with
all
the
child
predators
out
there
,
a
busy
road
,
cars
speeding
by
......
and
you
are
going
to
let
some
4
/
5
year
olds
wonder
around
cause
you
're
money
hungry
?

real
christian
of
you
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

whether
they
pay
me
or
not
,
if
their
parents
get
into
an
accident
,
stuck
in
traffic
,
etc.
the
last
thing
i
would
do
is
let
a
child
get
raped
because
i
was
n't
paid
.

excellent
service

i
could
easily
go
to
nordstrom
for
my
designer
jeans
and
pay
the
same
price
,
but
i
go
to
the
garment
district
for
their
service
.

previous
reviewers
said
they
were
pushy
and
i
can
understand
that
,
but
i
find
the
staff
more
helpful
than
anything
else
.

tiffany
is
fabulous
!

i
came
in
for
alterations
(
free
,
by
the
way
)
and
told
her
about
a
stain
i
had
on
my
new
leather
purse
.

she
immediately
went
to
the
back
,
brought
out
leather
cleaner
and
cleaned
my
purse
on
the
spot
.

i
did
n't
even
buy
the
bag
there
!

huge
selection
and
,
great
suggestions
from
the
staff
and
they
refer
you
to
reliable
places
if
they
do
n't
have
what
you
need
.

we
were
expecting
a
great
experience
,
when
we
recieved
a
friendly
greeting
by
the
hosts
.

the
atmosphere
was
nice
and
very
clean
.

the
menu
had
plenty
of
options
even
for
picky
eaters
.

the
service
was
ok
,
our
waitress
kept
forgetting
our
drinks
even
though
we
reminded
her
several
times
.

to
start
we
tried
the
guacamole
and
salsa
verde
,
it
was
completly
flavorless
.

we
should
have
left
then
.

we
orderd
our
meals
anyway
,
chimichangas
,
jalapeno
borritos
,
and
quesadillas
.

everything
was
bland
,
completely
void
of
any
spice
or
flavor
.

we
have
never
had
mexican
food
this
bad
,
it
was
just
simply
gross
.

hopefully
they
spice
things
up
or
they
wo
nt
be
in
business
long
.

i
recommend
la
hacienda

might
try
again

pros
:
*
jill
,
the
owner
,
is
very
nice
and
really
cares
about
her
feedback
*
pretty
nice
atmosphere
*
great
dessert
*
not
your
typical
veggie
selection
,
i
like
!

do
n't
know
where
else
you
can
find
purple
hull
peas
and
some
of
the
other
sides
.

cons
:
*
server
was
n't
very
pleasant
*
pretty
small
portion
on
the
blackened
catfish
*
overcooked
food
*
time
,
took
about
25
minutes
from
ordering
to
eating
.

half
the
tables
and
bar
were
empty
by
this
point
.

other
thoughts
:
will
try
this
place
again
.

there
must
be
a
reason
so
many
people
like
it
there
.

their
club
sandwich
looks
tasty
,
maybe
that
'll
change
my
mind
....
and
a
different
server
.

very
professional
/
very
helpful

the
people
at
fidelity
leasing
were
very
friendly
and
helpful
.

i
was
looking
for
a
car
but
did
not
really
know
what
i
wanted
and
they
were
very
helpful
and
took
the
time
to
first
figure
out
what
my
needs
were
and
showing
me
various
options
to
meet
those
needs
.

they
seemed
more
interested
in
helping
me
find
the
right
car
rather
then
just
make
a
sale
.

my
experience
with
them
was
great
-
low
stress
,
very
helpful
and
very
personal
.

after
finding
the
car
i
wanted
they
took
the
time
to
go
over
each
step
and
making
it
as
painless
as
possible
.

from
start
to
finish
they
were
top
notch
.

i
would
highly
recommend
calling
these
people
up
for
your
next
car
.

this
insurance
co.
is
a
joke
!!!

they
have
absolutely
no
communication
skills
whatsoever
.

if
you
do
n't
mind
being
robbed
,
cheated
or
lied
to
then
this
is
the
company
for
you
.

they
will
make
every
attempt
to
misinform
and
misrepresent
themselves
.

they
make
up
excuses
in
hopes
to
confuse
their
policy
holders
with
misinformation
.

as
an
example
they
took
payment
for
5
out
of
6
monthly
plan
premiums
for
a
yearly
policy
and
cancelled
the
contract
for
the
remainder
of
the
policy
for
reasons
they
stated
was
not
receiving
information
on
other
licensed
drivers
in
the
household
?

i
personally
provided
the
request
on
four
separate
occasions
and
they
claim
there
is
a
glitch
in
their
systems
?

ifa
is
an
acronym
for
i
m
a
f%#king
assh@%$e
!!!

fantastic
service
!

i
have
been
here
a
few
times
for
oil
changes
and
just
got
my
tires
,
alignment
and
state
inspection
done
yesterday
.

i
shopped
it
around
and
they
were
extremely
competitive
in
pricing
and
also
added
nitrogen
to
my
tires
which
should
extend
the
life
and
get
me
better
gas
mileage
.

it
also
came
with
free
balance
and
rotation
for
the
life
of
the
tires
!

what
made
it
perfect
was
that
they
offered
transportation
so
that
i
would
not
have
to
wait
there
or
take
time
off
of
work
to
go
back
and
forth
or
try
to
find
a
ride
.

great
service
,
great
pricing
and
super
convenient
!

i
also
did
not
feel
like
they
tried
to
sell
me
a
bunch
of
services
that
i
did
not
need
.

love
my
home
at
creekside

i
moved
to
creekside
apartments
in
august
2008
with
a
6
-
month
lease
and
have
just
extended
it
for
another
13
months
!

the
management
from
julie
and
janice
to
the
work
staff
,
esp.
edwin
,
are
just
wonderful
.

they
have
been
extremely
helpful
whenever
i
have
asked
for
help
.

although
the
apartments
are
facing
stokes
street
and
close
to
the
bascom
light
rail
,
the
location
is
surprisingly
quiet
.

i
have
never
had
any
problems
with
loud
neighbors
or
concerns
about
safety
.

the
apartments
are
within
walking
distance
to
trader
joe
's
,
whole
foods
,
and
other
stores
.

the
well
-
equipped
,
clean
gym
is
a
plus
!

great
place
to
live
if
you
work
in
and
around
downtown
san
jose
!

i
interviewed
several
contractors
for
a
kitchen
remodel
.

liberty
construction
shows
up
and
it
's
two
guys
...
all
i
get
is
100
%
sales
pitch
"
we
're
the
best
...
we
're
number
50
so
we
must
be
doing
something
right
...
look
at
all
these
certificates
that
say
we
're
great
"
.

not
once
did
i
feel
listened
to
like
they
actually
cared
about
what
i
wanted
,
all
they
were
interested
in
was
me
signing
a
contract
right
then
and
there
.

very
high
pressured
sales
and
with
the
reviews
of
many
others
bad
service
.

i
'm
glad
i
trusted
my
gut
and
did
n't
get
sucked
into
doing
business
with
them
.

find
someone
you
trust
that
actually
hears
you
and
wants
to
do
the
job
right
.

do
n't
waste
your
time
or
money
!

i
took
my
3
year
old
son
here
at
the
weekend
and
to
be
honest
,
apart
from
the
shark
walkway
,
i
thought
it
was
rubbish
and
overpriced
.

even
taking
into
account
the
fact
that
my
3
year
old
wanted
to
run
most
of
the
way
round
,
it
took
us
just
over
one
hour
start
to
finish
.

if
you
have
been
to
the
london
aquarium
i
would
not
even
bother
with
this
.

if
you
are
really
desperate
for
something
to
pass
the
time
and
are
willing
to
shell
out
the
best
part
of
l
30
for
2
two
people
then
go
for
it
.

(
for
some
reason
it
will
not
let
me
rate
it
one
star
-
it
is
not
rated
5
by
me
!

cranmore
dental
and
implant
clinic
:
i
could
not
recommend
dr
david
nelson
enough
.

i
had
a
severe
phobia
of
attending
the
dentist
until
i
met
and
was
treated
by
dr
nelson
.

he
instantaneously
put
me
at
ease
and
his
ongoing
treatments
have
been
absolutely
pain
free
.

my
previous
apprehension
has
been
dismissed
and
i
no
longer
have
a
sinking
feeling
when
my
next
appointment
is
due
!

in
addition
to
the
core
treatment
,
dr
nelson
has
impressed
me
further
with
his
concern
and
interest
in
the
well
-
being
of
his
patients
-
his
dental
work
underpinned
by
a
strong
duty
of
care
to
every
patient
.

he
is
always
prepared
to
go
the
extra
mile
to
ensure
that
any
patient
discomfort
is
dealt
with
immediately

best
salsa
(
hehehe
)

after
my
trees
were
cleaned
up
,
they
gave
me
a
jar
of
salsa
.

the
owner
warned
me
that
it
was
the
best
salsa
i
would
ever
had
,
and
he
was
right
.

no
joke
!

i
hate
to
say
check
them
out
just
for
the
salsa
,
but
james
,
i
need
another
jar
badly
:)
all
kidding
aside
,
they
are
a
very
good
company
,
i
have
a
hard
time
giving
any
service
biz
a
5
star
review
but
they
came
close
.

very
affordable
(
do
n't
call
it
cheap
)
and
their
trimmers
were
quick
and
courteous
when
i
got
home
from
work
.

and
the
salsa
,
be
sure
to
ask
for
a
jar
and
have
plenty
of
chips
around
,
you
will
need
them
.....

dr.
mann
killed
our
pet

yea
,
dr.
mann
ai
n't
so
great
.

we
took
our
beloved
kitty
to
him
and
it
came
back
dead
.

we
live
in
the
sub-division
around
the
corner
and
after
it
happened
and
we
brought
it
up
at
some
neighborhood
gatherings
we
discovered
that
several
people
from
this
neighborhood
alone
had
pets
go
to
dr.
mann
for
surgical
procedures
and
came
back
dead
.

if
you
take
him
here
for
shots
,
no
big
deal
but
i
would
never
let
this
man
apply
anesthetic
to
my
pet
ever
again
.

oh
,
they
also
charged
me
for
the
procedure
(
$
250
)
and
had
the
audacity
to
charge
me
a
$
25
'
disposal
'
fee
.

they
actually
itemized
it
as
a
disposal
fee
.

avoid
at
all
costs
.

one
of
the
worst
places

this
place
and
its
sister
store
peking
garden
are
the
worst
places
to
order
from
.

the
food
was
horrible
not
cooked
like
it
should
be
,
they
got
the
order
wrong
on
a
number
of
occasions
,
and
once
forgot
about
my
order
.

i
had
to
call
back
up
there
two
hours
later
and
the
lady
(
who
claimed
to
be
a
manager
)
said
my
food
was
on
the
way
,
and
she
did
nt
offer
to
compensate
me
in
any
kind
of
way
.

i
waited
another
30
mins
before
receiving
my
food
and
it
was
cold
.

in
my
opinon
this
place
should
be
shut
down
by
the
health
inspector
,
and
anyone
who
is
satisfied
with
there
service
and
food
has
never
eaten
at
a
real
asian
restaurant
.

gone
downhill
since
change
in
ownership

sigh
.

i
used
to
love
this
place
.

but
now
that
they
are
part
of
a
chain
,
service
has
slipped
.

i
am
waiting
longer
at
bna
for
my
pickups
and
last
time
i
parked
with
them
,
they
lost
my
car
key
.

lucky
i
had
a
spare
with
me
!

to
date
they
have
not
made
good
by
either
finding
the
key
or
paying
for
a
new
one
.

(
these
new
car
keys
are
expensive
to
copy
,
you
ca
n't
just
go
to
walmart
.
)

go
to
the
website
for
coupons
and
join
the
club
-
you
can
get
free
parking
.

however
,
with
bna
offering
one
day
of
free
parking
due
to
construction
of
the
new
rental
car
facility
,
it
may
be
cheaper
to
park
at
bna
.

wife
and
i
attempted
to
adopt
a
dog
and
was
nothing
but
frustrating
.

we
arrived
sunday
at
about
230
and
found
a
do
we
really
liked
.

we
were
told
that
we
could
n't
today
because
they
were
closing
soon
.

i
called
the
next
morning
to
let
then
know
my
wife
would
be
driving
in
.

they
gave
me
the
run
around
and
missing
paperwork
only
to
call
back
to
tell
me
someone
else
wanted
her
and
i
would
need
to
come
in
and
put
down
a
deposit
.

i
work
2
hours
away
but
offered
my
card
over
the
phone
.

they
refused
.

terrible
communication
as
well
.

at
one
point
they
told
me
the
dog
had
been
fixed
,
the
next
day
it
had
n't
.

huge
ammount
of
time
wasted
time
and
elevated
blood
pressure
.

college
is
a
joke
and
the
salon
is
a
joke
!

went
to
the
school
here
over
priced
!!!!!!

you
do
not
learn
the
things
you
were
promised
.

you
have
to
bring
in
your
own
models
and
they
have
to
pay
for
you
to
use
them
if
you
do
nt
then
you
can
graduate
!

going
back
after
graduating
you
r
told
you
get
a
discount
on
services
nope
you
do
nt
.

staff
is
under
educated
.

going
there
you
learn
the
school
does
not
care
about
the
services
given
just
about
the
money
.

over
priced
for
students
to
learn
!

beware
of
the
nail
program
you
are
not
taught
to
use
a
nail
drill
at
all
you
learn
the
old
fashioned
way
of
doing
nails
you
will
not
be
able
to
do
well
in
a
salon
!!!

beware
!

you
can
fool
people

this
store
is
proof
that
you
can
fool
people
with
good
advertising
.

they
convince
lots
of
people
that
they
are
a
great
store
,
when
in
fact
they
are
a
very
average
place
at
best
,
they
are
just
another
big
box
store
like
the
others
.

they
offer
sales
that
are
n't
really
sales
,
mislabeled
items
that
make
the
item
sound
like
a
good
deal
when
it
is
n't
,
a
bad
attitude
about
return
items
,
and
on
and
on
.

with
higher
than
average
prices
to
boot
!

so
do
n't
get
taken
in
,
keep
your
eyes
open
if
you
choose
to
shop
here
.

on
the
other
hand
,
the
richmond
ukrops
chain
is
known
for
its
charity
work
,
its
community
action
,
and
its
interest
in
the
public
welfare
.

never
again

do
n't
go
here
unless
you
want
to
sit
,
order
,
eat
and
be
asked
to
leave
all
in
a
matter
of
20
minutes
.

you
wo
n't
even
have
time
to
read
the
entire
menu
before
being
asked
to
order
and
if
you
ask
for
more
time
your
server
will
wait
at
the
table
.

this
is
the
only
place
i
have
ever
eaten
and
been
told
to
leave
because
other
people
were
waiting
.

i
was
told
to
take
my
coffee
to
go
if
i
wanted
to
finish
it
.

oh
,
and
their
liquor
license
was
expired
so
no
bloody
mary
or
mimosas
.

plus
the
drinks
are
self
service
,
have
fun
trying
to
negotiate
the
small
cafeteria
space
to
get
your
coffee
,
juice
or
water
.

go
next
door
to
the
ball
square
cafe
instead
.

i
guess
you
get
what
you
pay
for
.

i
tried
to
stay
here
for
a
few
nights
with
my
girlfriend
,
so
we
asked
for
a
single
queen
bed
.

we
got
there
,
and
we
were
treated
to
the
free
"
upgrade
"
of
a
room
with
two
double
beds
.

since
they
consider
this
an
upgrade
,
they
let
their
other
rooms
fill
up
and
would
not
change
our
room
.

then
we
got
put
in
a
room
with
a
huge
gap
under
the
door
....
right
next
to
the
ice
machine
.

we
could
hear
every
single
thing
that
happened
outside
like
it
was
inside
our
room
.

when
i
finally
found
someone
at
the
desk
who
could
speak
english
,
they
moved
our
room
,
but
we
still
did
not
receive
the
single
queen
we
had
"
reserved
"

i
was
thoroughly
impressed
!

i
had
a
problem
with
the
tile
in
my
bathroom
coming
apart
.

i
called
a
few
different
businesses
in
the
area
to
get
estimates
,
they
were
n't
the
cheapest
i
found
but
very
reasonable
.

the
best
part
is
i
got
my
whole
bathroom
remodeled
for
about
the
same
price
the
other
compan's
were
quoting
just
to
fix
the
shower
tile
and
fixtures
.

they
had
the
work
done
in
about
half
the
time
quoted
which
made
me
and
my
wife
extremely
happy
.

we
have
had
nothing
but
compliments
on
our
bathroom
when
guest
come
over
-
who
would
have
guessed
that
one
?

very
nice
work
and
friendly
guys
too
.

best
money
i
've
spent
on
remodeling
ever
.

i
highly
recommend
any
one
considering
home
repair
to
give
these
guys
a
call
.

new
training
centre
is
excellent

the
award
dance
centre
has
moved
from
its
holderness
road
site
to
a
new
complex
on
chamberlain
road
hull
.

the
new
centre
has
4
studios
planned
and
now
boasts
the
largest
single
dance
floor
area
in
kingston
upon
hull
.

the
classes
cover
all
age
and
skill
ranges
,
with
ballroom
,
latin
,
sequence
,
street
,
disco
,
line
dancing
,
ballet
,
tap
&
jazz
.

we
have
attended
a
ward
dance
centre
for
over
a
year
and
really
enjoy
the
friendly
and
welcoming
way
we
are
taught
ballroom
and
latin
as
well
as
the
fun
filled
social
dance
evening
held
every
saturday
evening
....

it
is
not
really
possible
to
score
this
school
too
highly
,
we
would
give
it
12
out
of
10
and
5
stars
across
the
board

&
anne

i
purchased
a
2
-
year
old
certified
pre-owned
bmw
from
this
dealership
.

the
night
i
drove
back
home
,
i
found
that
the
rear
window
has
some
leakage
.

(
you
can
hear
the
wind
while
driving
on
highway
.

very
likely
it
needs
a
new
window
seal
)
.

i
admit
that
i
should
have
paid
attention
to
this
kind
of
little
things
while
test
drive
.

(
but
this
is
a
certified
car
from
a
dealer
.
)

so
i
brought
the
car
back
the
second
day
.

they
told
me
that
this
is
not
under
warranty
and
want
to
charge
me
$
175
just
to
diagnose
the
problem
!

who
knows
how
much
they
want
me
to
pay
to
fix
this
thing
.

i
walked
away
.

so
my
advice
is
that
never
trust
this
dealer
.

stay
away
as
far
as
possible
.

perfect
practice

after
i
had
chosen
the
fountain
dental
practice
they
provided
a
slick
and
professional
service
from
start
to
finish
.

everyone
was
friendly
from
the
receptionist
to
the
surgeon
herself
,
putting
me
at
my
ease
and
explaining
the
whole
process
,
both
initially
and
then
as
we
went
along
.

surgery
visit
timings
were
always
made
to
suit
me
and
not
them
and
they
gave
me
the
feeling
that
i
mattered
and
was
important
to
them
.

the
surgery
itself
is
slick
,
modern
and
very
relaxed
and
i
always
felt
that
i
was
in
capable
hands
.

my
dental
surgeon
,
dr.
lucy
nichols
is
clearly
a
dental
perfectionist
and
clearly
proud
both
of
the
work
she
does
and
the
reputation
she
has
established
.

everyone
was
so
helpful
that
i
can
not
wait
to
go
back
.....

wonderful
service
for
large
group

i
had
my
wedding
luncheon
at
this
bj
s
restaurant
,
and
it
was
one
of
the
best
choices
that
i
made
.

it
was
a
great
deal
--
we
paid
a
certain
amount
per
person
,
and
my
husband
and
i
chose
4
types
of
pizza
and
the
servers
brought
out
as
much
as
we
wanted
.

we
were
also
served
salad
and
soda
.

we
had
a
large
party
,
about
fifty
people
or
so
,
and
yet
everything
was
served
quickly
and
we
all
had
a
wonderful
time
.

even
though
we
were
only
supposed
to
have
those
specific
types
of
pizza
,
when
guests
asked
for
a
different
type
,
it
was
brought
out
with
no
charge
to
us
!

i
really
appreciate
bj
s
for
making
that
special
day
even
better
with
their
wonderful
food
and
service
.

wonderful

i
went
to
ohm
after
reading
some
of
the
reviews
.

i
go
to
school
in
the
area
and
usually
wait
until
i
go
home
to
get
my
hair
cut
.

i
decided
it
was
time
to
grow
up
and
made
an
appointment
.

sierra
was
my
stylist
and
i
love
what
she
did
.

i
have
wavy
hair
and
she
cut
to
my
hair
style
.

it
was
the
first
time
i
had
left
a
salon
with
my
hair
curly
.

usually
they
blow
dry
it
out
and
i
have
to
wait
until
i
wash
it
to
see
what
it
will
look
like
in
its
natural
state
.

but
she
did
a
fabulous
job
letting
me
know
what
she
was
doing
at
all
times
and
styled
my
hair
in
a
way
i
could
do
it
at
home
.

it
was
n't
completly
impossible
!!!!

i
am
definitely
going
back

after
recently
relocating
to
south
bend
,
we
were
looking
for
a
delicious
,
fun
,
yet
elegant
establishment
for
new
year
s
eve
dinner
.

we
were
disappointed
with
this
holiday
dinner
due
to
the
overall
flavor
and
price
of
the
meal
,
and
accessibility
to
the
jazz
club
.

the
meal
was
extremely
overpriced
and
lacked
flavor
,
especially
for
being
a
special
nye
menu
.

the
limited
menu
had
few
appetizing
options
and
the
nye
special
packages
were
way
overpriced
.

after
our
meal
,
our
server
found
us
a
table
in
the
jazz
club
where
we
were
informed
it
would
be
another
$
10
/
person
to
stay
and
listen
to
the
band
,
despite
the
fact
we
had
just
finished
a
dinner
there
and
were
intending
to
enjoy
their
drink
list
.

this
was
a
less
than
impressive
experience
at
trio
's
.

run
for
the
hills
...
you
'll
be
much
better
off
!

one
night
was
too
much
.

first
room
had
used
tissues
next
to
the
bed
and
i
requested
it
be
rectified
.

i
was
then
moved
to
another
room
around
the
back
where
the
room
was
dirty
,
the
shower
was
dirty
with
other
people
s
hair
in
it
,
the
toilet
seat
was
peeling
and
rough
and
the
bathroom
was
full
of
mould
.

i
called
reception
to
ask
if
they
knew
the
state
the
room
was
in
and
was
told
"
this
is
a
days
inn
,
not
the
hilton
"
and
the
receptionist
then
hung
up
on
me
.

to
warn
you
to
stay
away
from
this
place
just
is
n't
enough
.

there
was
not
one
ounce
of
caring
involved
and
anyone
i
can
warn
about
the
complete
lack
of
service
will
be
warned
.

grocery
and
daily
needs
store

before
using
fusionretail
before
installing
fusionretail
store
was
running
on
a
dos
based
software
.

we
were
having
a
major
problem
in
maintaining
cash
.

being
a
grocery
shop
,
maintaining
5000
different
products
was
a
challenging
job
.

managing
pos
counter
without
barcoding
was
really
a
tough
time
.

how
fusionretail
has
overcome
these
issues
?

fusionretail
helps
us
to
maintain
the
store
in
an
organised
way
.

usage
of
product
barcodes
and
smooth
maintenance
of
inventory
with
proper
recording
of
transactions
like
sale
,
purchase
and
returns
was
never
easy
before
.

how
long
does
it
take
to
train
new
people
at
work
?

billing
takes
15
minutes
and
back
office
jobs
takes
1
day
's
training
how
fast
your
support
queries
get
answered
?

over
telephone
,
immediate
.

on
call
,
it
takes
a
day
to
get
our
issues
resolved
.

ca
n't
wait
to
go
back
!!!

this
is
by
far
the
best
b&b
that
we
have
ever
stayed
at
!

we
were
in
santa
fe
for
a
special
event
and
our
hosts
rented
out
the
el
paradero
for
all
their
guests
to
stay
at
.

we
could
not
have
been
more
welcomed
,
more
comfortable
or
more
well
fed
.

the
weekend
was
perfect
in
every
way
,
in
large
part
to
sue
and
her
great
staff
.

everyone
was
so
friendly
and
really
went
out
of
their
way
to
make
sure
everything
went
well
.

we
can
not
wait
to
go
back
to
santa
fe
and
to
this
great
b&b
...
especially
my
4
year
old
,
who
made
friends
with
ms.
sue
and
all
the
ladies
,
and
has
talked
about
them
since
we
left
!

we
would
highly
recommend
the
el
paradero
on
your
next
trip
to
santa
fe
!

disatisfied
customer
,
i
went
through
kitchen
aid
and
used
one
of
their
recommended
vendors
.

a&e
came
out
,
charged
$
129
fee
just
to
walk
in
the
door
.

i
needed
a
part
for
my
appliance
,
the
cost
was
very
high
so
i
said
never
mind
,
paid
the
fee
and
called
a
local
business
for
a
second
quote
.

the
second
vendor
charged
$
55
(
less
than
half
of
what
a&e
charges
)
to
come
and
applied
that
to
the
price
of
the
repair
service
(
which
a&e
does
not
)
.

their
quote
came
in
at
half
the
price
of
a&e
for
the
same
work
and
same
part
.

seems
to
me
like
a&e
charges
way
more
than
necessary
!

very
disappointed
in
kitchen
aid
as
well
,
i
thought
that
they
pre-screened
their
vendors
for
price
and
quality
of
work
,
obviously
they
do
not
!

lovely
nails
on
cayuga
st.
in
lewiston
,
ny

first
let
me
start
out
by
saying
,
that
i
have
had
very
nice
pedicures
at
lovely
nails
on
military
road
.

i
was
very
excited
that
a
salon
was
opening
in
lewiston
,
as
i
live
in
youngstown
.

i
was
in
two
weeks
ago
and
had
the
worst
pedicure
that
i
have
had
in
my
life
.

there
were
four
of
us
and
i
was
taken
first
by
a
gentleman
.

i
put
my
foot
in
the
water
and
it
was
cool
.

he
did
warm
it
up
.

he
also
hurt
my
toes
will
pushing
my
cuticles
back
.

if
the
pedicure
lasted
20
mins.
,
that
was
a
stretch
.

the
other
ladies
had
a
similar
experience
,
both
had
nail
polish
on
a
couple
of
toes
.

none
of
us
will
be
using
their
services
again
,
which
is
a
shame
.

good
service
-
limited
results

andrew
was
helpful
and
knowledgeable
about
acupuncture
re
:
infertility
.

he
was
willing
to
talk
to
me
about
my
specific
issues
and
develop
a
plan
of
action
.

the
office
is
shared
with
a
foot
doctor
and
it
's
very
sterile
and
medical
feeling
,
which
i
liked
.

the
down
side
was
that
sometimes
there
was
a
lot
of
noise
in
the
hallway
from
other
patients
/
doctors
.

i
worked
with
andrew
for
2
months
and
did
acupuncture
and
herbs
.

the
sessions
were
nice
and
i
felt
relaxed
after
them
but
did
not
notice
any
changes
with
my
cycles
.

i
know
it
can
take
a
while
for
results
and
did
n't
expect
a
miracle
,
but
after
2
months
i
felt
like
it
was
not
entirely
worth
the
cost
/
time
.

(
i
am
also
a
little
suspicious
of
all
these
glowing
reviews
...
)

friendly
,
clean
and
excellent
location

the
staff
was
very
helpful
,
and
gave
us
good
advice
on
day
and
night
time
activities
.

common
room
was
comfortable
and
clean
,
very
good
room
to
read
or
relax
.
-

a
great
breakfast
which
was
included
every
morning
until
9:30
am
;
yummy
fresh
parisian
croissants
.

comfortable
and
clean
beds
,
a
bit
noisy
when
people
were
coming
in
late
from
a
night
out
,
but
we
did
n't
mind
too
much
as
we
were
also
just
coming
in
from
a
night
out
!

the
location
is
really
stellar
!

it
is
next
to
gare
du
nord
and
a
five
minute
walk
to
sacre
coeur
which
is
excellent
for
shopping
.

it
is
close
to
bus
lines
for
opera
plaza
,
galleries
lafayette
,
and
the
famous
flea
market
.

we
really
enjoyed
our
stay
and
would
definitely
stay
at
the
vintage
hostel
again
.

just
autos
thank
you
!

was
fast
and
easy
,
just
had
our
car
returned
this
morning
,
i
would
recommend
these
mobile
mechanics
for
sure
.

they
certainly
know
what
they
are
doing
.

the
mechanic
came
to
our
place
and
sorted
out
our
car
s
problems
,
he
explained
the
problem
and
was
very
up
front
and
honest
,
it
was
towed
to
the
workshop
as
the
gearbox
was
not
working
(
he
explained
it
better
)
.

they
phoned
the
same
day
,
confirmed
it
was
the
gearbox
quoted
me
the
job
,
i
gave
the
go
ahead
.

now
my
car
s
gears
and
brakes
have
never
run
so
well
...
ever
it
s
like
driving
a
new
car
.

so
yes
,
i
would
n't
hesitate
in
recommending
the
team
at
just
autos
for
easy
professional
car
repairs
,
thank
you
just
autos
for
your
help
.

i
stopped
in
today
@
yards
brewery
.

i
must
say
,
i
was
impressed
with
the
size
of
the
bar
area
and
lounge
,
&
i
liked
that
you
could
see
the
brewery
right
thru
the
glass
!

i
had
a
sampler
of
ipa
,
brawler
,
love
stout
&
esa
.

all
were
awesome
,
&
i
had
a
dogwood
grilled
cheese
which
was
enjoyable
with
the
fine
beers
.

after
my
sampler
&
sandwich
,
i
asked
for
a
pint
of
there
nitrogen
love
stout
,
i
must
say
i
was
impressed
,
with
the
great
taste
&
i
am
a
guiness
lover
so
coming
from
me
,
i
think
this
is
better
,
it
s
less
dry
&
smoother
!

if
you
are
in
philly
you
have
to
come
check
this
place
out
!

the
only
negative
i
have
abou
this
place
is
the
parking
!

i
left
with
a
case
of
brawler
!!!!

oil
change
disaster

my
wife
had
taken
her
'07
ford
fusion
in
for
a
routine
oil
change
.

a
couple
days
after
the
oil
change
,
the
engine
ran
rough
,
the
low
oil
pressure
light
would
come
on
sporadically
,
and
the
engine
would
whir
loudly
.

turns
out
the
engine
had
no
oil
,
and
when
oil
was
put
it
,
it
would
just
run
out
of
the
filter
.

there
could
have
(
hopefully
does
n't
have
)
major
damage
to
the
engine
.

all
of
this
started
after
their
oil
change
.

once
they
realized
their
mistake
they
sent
a
mechanic
and
tow
truck
to
my
wife
's
work
and
towed
it
back
to
fix
it
.

i
would
not
recommend
this
shop
for
anything
,
not
even
something
as
simple
as
an
oil
change
.

plus
they
will
overcharge
you
for
just
about
everything
,
and
smile
while
doing
it
.

liars
,
negative
stars
!

took
my
cruze
in
twice
for
poor
fuel
economy
.

the
first
time
they
claimed
to
get
reasonable
mpg
.

however
,
they
would
never
drive
the
car
with
me
in
it
to
prove
their
findings
.

i
wonder
if
they
were
going
down
a
hill
!

they
told
me
to
bring
it
back
after
5000
miles
.

i
brought
it
back
with
9000
miles
.

they
"
finished
"
the
work
and
told
me
the
car
was
ready
.

i
found
out
they
did
not
even
drive
the
car
,
stated
they
looked
at
it
before
.

they
still
would
not
drive
the
car
with
me
to
show
their
mpg
number
.

they
also
claimed
not
to
see
anything
wrong
with
the
blower
fan
(
a
seperate
issue
)
,
but
when
i
drove
the
car
home
i
had
the
same
symptoms
.

i
will
never
purchace
another
vehicle
from
vic
canever
.

great
job

i
want
to
say
that
mike
did
a
great
job
for
our
family
in
our
time
of
need
.

both
my
grandparents
passed
away
4
months
apart
and
mike
was
very
understanding
.

it
was
a
very
trying
time
for
my
family
and
myself
yet
mike
took
the
time
to
greet
each
and
every
one
one
of
us
.

he
is
very
professional
in
his
position
as
a
director
and
yet
he
still
made
time
to
be
compassionate
for
what
we
were
all
going
through
.

i
'm
sure
it
s
not
every
day
that
a
funeral
director
sees
the
same
family
in
such
a
short
time
.

my
grandfather
passed
away
silently
in
his
sleep
,
and
my
grandmother
passed
away
after
a
short
struggle
with
cancer
.

both
my
grandparents
looked
as
natural
as
could
be
expected
.

thank
you
mike
for
all
your
help
professionally
and
personally
.

poor
service

if
you
like
the
drama
described
in
popular
sitcom
'
seinfeld
'
,
you
will
see
it
here
.

we
signed
our
name
in
about
6:00
pm
.

there
were
3
names
before
us
.

the
greeter
said
there
was
about
15
minutes
waiting
.

however
,
we
waited
and
waited
and
in
the
mean
time
,
saw
4
groups
of
people
simply
just
paraded
in
without
signing
there
names
.

this
sign
in
policy
is
posted
by
the
restaurant
"
no
reservation
,
sign
your
name
here
"
.

i
had
to
ask
the
greeter
,
he
explained
his
reasons
with
broken
english
.

i
could
not
understand
any
his
reasons
.

i
could
only
take
it
as
they
would
seat
the
people
they
know
first
.

my
conclusion
is
that
you
should
only
go
there
if
you
want
to
wait
a
least
an
hour
and
see
all
kinds
other
people
being
seated
before
you
.

instructor
never
showed
up
!

january
15th
--
we
were
signed
up
for
saturday
's
2
pm
class
"
beginning
yoga
with
brittany
.
"

we
even
arrived
10
minutes
early
as
the
website
suggests
.

the
instructor
did
not
show
up
!

we
waited
until
2:25
pm
and
then
left
.

there
were
2
in
our
group
,
and
a
3rd
person
was
also
in
the
parking
lot
waiting
for
this
class
.

well
,
not
much
i
can
say
except
i
'm
very
disappointed
with
this
experience
.

this
was
our
first
visit
to
your
studio
.

in
today
's
instant
world
,
there
's
no
reason
for
the
instructor
not
to
even
have
given
us
a
phone
call
or
e-mail
if
she
was
going
to
be
late
.

as
a
yoga
studio
,
i
'm
sure
you
're
all
aware
that
all
actions
generate
karma
.

and
sometimes
karma
can
manifest
itself
on
a
bad
review
on
google
.

finest
??

really
??

i
beg
to
differ
.

this
place
is
marginal
at
best
.

not
very
welcoming
and
focused
mostly
on
keeping
little
kids
entertained
.

i
was
not
impressed
,
and
quite
frustrated
at
their
lack
of
rating
for
their
courses
.

i
understand
not
wanting
to
put
labels
like
5.10
on
an
indoor
course
,
because
yes
,
it
is
not
the
same
,
but
some
clear
understanding
of
the
difficulty
of
one
course
to
another
is
nice
when
you
are
an
intermediate
climber
looking
to
improve
.

i
do
n't
want
to
waste
my
time
on
routes
set
for
children
,
but
i
do
n't
want
to
take
on
something
i
ca
n't
handle
just
to
strain
myself
to
exhaustion
.

rate
the
routes
,
with
understandable
markings
and
a
more
detailed
system
than
easy
,
moderate
,
and
hard
.

again
,
a
great
outing
for
the
kids
,
a
frustration
for
an
out
of
town
climber
.

best
dj's
in
town
!

wow
!

these
guys
were
the
best
.

they
were
thorough
,
high
class
,
and
went
above
and
beyond
.

we
never
had
to
worry
about
a
thing
,
and
they
led
the
way
the
whole
time
.

they
asked
us
things
that
we
would
have
never
have
thought
of
,
and
took
extra
time
to
meet
with
us
when
we
needed
it
before
the
wedding
.

having
a
team
was
the
best
because
they
kept
the
flow
of
the
wedding
going
the
whole
time
!

they
may
look
young
but
do
n't
let
that
fool
you
,
as
their
knowledge
of
music
far
surpassed
what
we
expected
.

i
am
a
music
junkie
that
grew
up
in
the
80's
,
and
my
dad
worked
for
a
record
label
in
the
1960's
.

so
we
did
n't
expect
them
to
even
know
some
of
the
requests
that
we
asked
that
night
.

they
just
really
know
their
stuff
!

never
fear
going
to
the
dentist
again
!

i
'm
61
years
old
and
have
dental
problems
my
entire
life
.

by
the
age
of
24
i
stopped
going
to
the
dentist
.

my
fear
and
discomfort
from
dental
work
scared
me
!

it
took
all
the
courage
i
could
muster
to
make
an
appointment
.

at
the
front
door
of
his
office
,
i
nearly
turned
around
.

i
considered
just
leaving
after
going
inside
and
nearly
did
.

doctor
gonzales
and
his
entire
staff
are
the
most
professional
people
i
have
ever
dealt
with
.

they
made
me
feel
confident
in
what
they
would
do
,
and
treated
me
like
a
member
of
their
own
family
.

i
never
felt
pain
or
discomfort
.

the
ability
to
smile
and
eat
again
can
only
be
described
as
a
whole
new
lease
on
life
.

thank
you
doctor
gonzales
,
doctor
stout
,
eva
marie
and
the
entire
staff

horrible
service
and
food

not
only
is
this
place
too
expensive
for
what
it
is
,
it
s
horrible
!

in
the
past
,
i
got
a
steak
and
there
was
more
fat
and
rough
pieces
than
there
was
good
steak
(
and
this
was
the
sirloin
!
)
,
the
sides
were
drenched
with
butter
and
the
salad
was
a
little
on
the
brown
side
.

today
we
went
for
a
party
(
during
lunch
,
so
the
place
was
empty
)
with
about
25
other
people
.

it
took
over
1.5
hours
for
our
food
to
come
out
and
by
that
time
my
8
month
old
had
it
!

does
it
seriously
take
that
long
for
a
soup
and
salad
?

i
was
a
waitress
for
years
and
a
key
rule
is
to
serve
customers
with
small
children
before
others
,
as
i
was
the
last
to
get
my
food
.

i
would
not
recommend
having
a
party
here
or
even
going
here
.

texas
roadhouse
is
way
better
!!

spay
and
neuter
service
.

i
have
no
doubt
that
the
rescue
is
wonderful
.

but
i
had
my
cat
spayed
through
their
reduced
/
free
spay
and
neuter
program
and
the
vet
they
sent
us
to
was
first
of
all
a
hour
and
a
half
away
,
and
4
days
later
we
had
to
bring
them
to
our
normal
vet
because
the
vets
at
the
place
in
wisconsin
did
a
crappy
job
and
they
got
infections
.

my
vet
even
said
it
was
not
my
fault
it
was
the
vet
that
did
the
surgery
,
so
i
would
not
recommend
getting
that
program
unless
you
have
an
extra
hundred
dollars
or
so
for
antibiotics
and
a
vet
visit
.

you
'd
think
they
would
do
a
good
job
but
they
do
n't
care
unless
they
are
getting
paid
full
price
.

which
is
so
dumb
.

not
to
mention
the
fact
that
they
gave
us
our
cats
back
not
even
30
minutes
after
they
were
out
from
surgery
.

billing
issues
...

i
had
a
routine
surgery
for
an
ingrown
toenail
.

my
insurance
company
,
blue
cross
/
blue
shield
paid
the
fees
and
everything
was
fine
.

then
i
got
a
bill
for
$
483.00
.

the
doctor
's
office
said
that
payments
had
been
"
reversed
"
.

blue
cross
has
no
record
of
aa
reversal
.

the
office
refused
my
requests
to
see
what
they
got
from
bc
/
bs
.

they
eventually
turned
it
over
to
a
collection
agency
and
now
will
not
even
discuss
the
matter
.

i
eventually
decided
to
just
pay
the
balance
even
though
the
doctor
has
already
been
paid
,
but
now
the
collection
agency
is
trying
to
say
another
reversal
of
$
160.00
has
come
through
.

it
was
an
ingrown
toenail
.

how
much
could
it
possibly
cost
?

not
only
am
i
being
bilked
for
money
i
do
not
owe
,
the
office
staff
is
rude
to
boot
.

i
think
this
office
has
some
serious
billing
practice
issues
!

we
have
been
blessed
to
find
elite
flyers
online
and
would
not
use
anyone
else
to
handle
our
postcards
,
posters
,
etc
.

we
were
looking
for
a
company
with
decent
rates
as
our
company
was
just
getting
started
.

they
have
the
best
rates
and
great
customer
service
.

on
one
order
,
we
needed
it
rushed
and
shipped
to
a
different
state
.

they
did
that
with
no
problem
.

i
also
appreciate
their
honesty
.

i
sent
a
graphic
that
would
have
been
distorted
if
printed
as
it
was
.

they
called
and
worked
with
me
to
fix
it
so
that
it
would
look
perfect
.

they
recently
surprised
me
a
larger
order
.

i
ordered
1000
postcards
,
we
normally
order
5000
or
more
.

because
they
had
room
to
do
5000
,
they
created
the
larger
amount
,
and
shipped
them
early
.

i
recommend
this
company
to
anyone
and
everyone
that
needs
great
work
done
at
a
reasonable
rate
!

they
have
a
customer
for
life
in
us
!

sheisters

i
made
the
mistake
of
buying
from
these
thieves
.

i
paid
2
k
cash
for
a
truck
with
a
blown
motor
.

their
so
called
mechanic
said
the
engine
was
good
and
"
there
is
nothing
mechanicly
wrong
with
this
truck
"
.

well
i
think
a
blown
engine
falls
under
the
catagory
of
mechanics
right
?

anyway
they
jimmy
rigged
it
so
i
could
drive
it
home
.

the
next
day
i
took
it
to
2
auto
shops
and
they
both
told
me
the
same
thing
,
engine
is
junk
.

i
called
and
got
the
same
runaround
on
hold
and
noone
calls
you
back
.

from
a
moral
standpoint
,
you
guys
are
really
gon
na
take
2,000
bucks
from
someone
that
needs
that
truck
to
work
and
support
his
family
when
you
know
it
s
just
a
piece
of
scrap
metal
?

if
it
lasted
1
month
i
could
suck
it
up
but
1
day
?

grimy
work
you
guys
do
.

buy
your
kids
somethin
nice
with
my
2
k
bucks
.

best
stationery
store
in
bethesda

papeluna
,
a
cute
mom
/
pop
custom
printing
and
paper
store
,
just
opened
a
few
days
ago
.

it
is
right
on
the
hustle
and
bustle
of
wisconsin
ave
but
some
might
miss
it
as
it
is
nestled
in
between
subway
sandwiches
and
modell
's
.

i
popped
in
after
my
afternoon
pumpkin
spice
latte
break
at
starbucks
.

it
's
an
adorable
little
store
filled
with
lots
of
stationery
goodness
.

cards
,
wrapping
paper
,
paper
,
and
an
area
to
sit
down
and
talk
with
someone
to
design
your
own
invitations
or
for
whatever
else
your
custom
printing
needs
may
be
.

i
gave
the
woman
i
spoke
with
today
a
"
you
've
been
yelped
!
"
card
to
let
her
know
that
yelp
may
be
a
good
tool
for
helping
spreading
the
word
about
papeluna
.

i
ended
up
buying
a
birthday
card
and
would
probably
come
back
for
more

watch
out
for
your
wallet
!

this
company
is
overpriced
for
their
services
.

they
pride
themselves
on
being
an
event
and
team
building
company
for
corporate
clients
but
you
better
believe
they
are
going
to
mark
you
up
on
that
feel
good
premise
.

on
a
recent
event
quote
that
i
had
done
,
they
came
in
thousands
of
dollars
over
their
local
competition
.

the
craziest
part
is
that
they
are
n't
even
based
locally
at
the
city
i
'm
in
-
they
just
have
'
teams
'
in
areas
through
the
country
.

i
've
spoken
to
vendors
who
are
used
by
them
who
had
nothing
good
to
say
about
the
company
as
well
and
in
fact
were
afraid
to
quote
events
against
them
even
though
they
openly
admitted
that
they
felt
canadian
outback
was
pricing
their
entertainment
out
of
the
market
and
doing
more
to
hurt
their
business
than
help
them
.

be
warned
-
they
'll
ltake
you
for
everything
they
can
.

believe
me
.

this
is
the
premier
university
in
virginia
.

it
is

the
largest
.

with

the

orr
's
a
nightmare
!

do
n't
go
!

my
boyfriend
and
i
were
woken
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
at
our
campsite
by
drunken
kids
who
'd
arrived
around
1:00
am
and
were
drinking
at
the
springs
.

when
we
complained
to
the
management
(
as
we
were
instructed
to
do
if
there
were
any
problems
)
,
nothing
happened
!

then
,
the
next
morning
,
when
we
,
among
many
other
irate
guests
,
asked
to
speak
to
the
owner
,
he
refused
to
do
so
.

not
only
that
,
but
he
told
us
,
via
his
manager
,
that
it
was
our
responsibility
to
get
up
a
second
time
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
call
the
night
staff
if
the
problem
continued
,
even
though
his
manager
did
nothing
the
first
time
to
stop
the
kids
.

orr
is
not
relaxing
,
it
's
not
a
safe
space
,
and
the
owner
is
awful
.

to
add
insult
to
injury
,
he
refused
to
refund
our
money
.

do
n't
go
!

fhs
is
a
good
high
school
--
c
/
o
1998

i
enjoyed
my
time
at
franklin
high
school
.

we
had
relatively
good
facilities
at
the
time
--
decent
science
labs
,
with
multiple
hoods
and
access
to
good
equipment
;
nice
gymnasiums
,
and
a
well
-
funded
music
department
(
i
was
in
the
guitar
ensemble
)
.

now
,
of
course
,
there
's
a
new
building
,
with
presumably
better
facilities
.

all
to
the
good
.

for
those
who
care
,
a
good
proportion
of
the
my
class
went
on
to
4
-
year
colleges
,
many
of
them
ranked
in
the
top
50
of
us
news
.

if
i
remember
,
students
went
to
dartmouth
,
u.
penn
,
duke
,
bu
,
william
and
mary
,
vassar
,
howard
,
and
carnegie
mellon
,
among
others
.

many
students
went
to
rutgers
,
including
their
top
-
ranked
pharmacy
program
.

the
point
is
--
fhs
gives
you
the
opportunity
to
make
it
to
a
good
college
,
but
you
need
to
work
hard
.

absolutely
the
best
little
motel
on
the
coast
!

i
've
stayed
at
this
fabulous
little
motel
two
years
running
,
and
i
have
to
say
it
's
one
of
the
best
lodging
experiences
i
've
ever
had
on
the
coast
...
and
i
'm
even
comparing
it
to
the
big
resorts
i
've
stayed
at
!

a
large
group
of
my
friends
and
i
rent
almost
the
whole
motel
every
year
for
a
weekend
,
and
the
experience
and
stay
have
always
been
five
-
star
.

the
rooms
are
so
clean
,
the
managers
/
owners
are
the
nicest
people
,
the
place
feels
so
homey
,
and
the
location
and
grounds
are
beautiful
.

there
's
a
restaurant
nearby
(
walking
distance
)
with
a
great
breakfast
,
and
a
market
across
the
street
.

the
motel
is
very
well
maintained
,
and
the
managers
are
so
accomodating
,
it
's
kind
of
like
visiting
family
each
year
!
;-)

i
honestly
ca
n't
rave
enough
about
this
place
...
it
's
really
a
hidden
gem
worth
checking
out
!

my
favorite
cuban
cafe
in
orlando

i
have
been
eating
cuban
for
a
long
time
,
sandwiches
mainly
along
with
other
dishes
..

i
love
cuban
coffee
,
colada
...
mmmm
anyways
i
found
this
place
and
ca
n't
stop
going
there
,
i
stop
in
at
least
once
a
week
and
anytime
i
'm
in
the
area
for
a
cuban
coffee
or
snack
.

the
place
is
chill
and
comfortable
.

they
do
n't
speak
the
best
english
but
enough
to
get
by
.

they
bake
bread
fresh
daily
,
they
do
n't
press
their
sandwiches
which
is
the
way
i
like
it
,
and
the
meat
is
always
fresh
.

they
have
a
great
lunch
special
with
your
choice
of
meat
,
chicken
,
steak
,
or
pork
and
rice
and
black
beans
and
fried
plantains
.

and
their
breakfast
is
awesome
!!

i
can
not
describe
how
delicious
the
mango
and
cheese
pastries
and
the
omelets
are
to
die
for
.

stop
in
and
have
a
bite
you
wo
n't
regret
it
.

a
slice
of
heaven
in
winter
park
off
forsyth
!

highly
recommended
.

i
have
been
going
to
warner
family
for
a
number
of
years
and
would
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
.

i
've
read
some
of
the
reviews
below
and
would
like
to
state
that
yes
,
like
any
other
doctor
s
office
there
is
sometimes
a
wait
(
depending
on
what
other
patients
are
being
seen
for
)
and
some
of
the
tests
and
procedures
that
are
ran
can
be
costly
(
just
like
they
would
be
for
any
other
medical
tests
elsewhere
if
you
do
not
have
insurance
)
...

i
have
seen
several
of
the
providers
from
the
office
and
have
not
once
been
shown
anything
but
care
and
consideration
.

i
ca
nt
speak
for
them
but
any
tests
or
appointments
they
recommend
are
probably
in
the
best
interests
of
us
(
the
patient
)
and
you
have
the
ability
to
decline
anything
that
they
suggest
to
you
.

i
personally
have
had
wonderful
service
and
if
you
re
truely
looking
for
a
family
practice
...
warner
family
is
the
place
for
you
.

not
what
i
expected
!

we
read
the
good
reviews
before
going
and
had
high
hopes
..
but
to
our
dismay
it
did
nt
turn
out
that
way
!

~
it
took
over
40
mins
to
be
taken
to
our
table
,
once
there
it
took
another
20
mins
to
get
our
orders
and
a
further
45
mins
till
our
starters
landed
on
our
table
.

very
frustrating
for
a
restaurant
that
has
1
rosette
and
is
supposedly
renowned
for
the
service
...
hmm
there
was
no
canape's
or
amuse
to
keep
us
occupied
,
once
we
complained
about
the
wait
they
took
us
something
to
nibble
on
but
that
took
us
getting
out
our
chairs
and
wondering
round
to
do
that
and
it
was
impossible
to
get
anyone
s
attention
.

scallops
were
overcooked
and
the
foie
gras
was
cold
but
the
rest
of
the
food
was
lovely
.

on
top
of
that
though
they
tried
to
charge
us
service
charge
just
to
rub
it
it
....

would
n't
go
back
as
there
are
a
lot
of
places
a
lot
better
and
cheaper
.

nice
selection
,
very
clean
,
friendly
staff
!

hot
iron
has
become
a
favorite
of
our
family
.

everyone
can
get
the
signature
dish
with
ingredients
and
spices
that
they
want
and
have
the
fun
of
watching
it
cook
.

the
staff
are
very
friendly
and
conscientious
.

they
always
ask
if
you
have
meat
in
your
dish
,
(
for
vegetarians
like
me
)
,
they
scrub
an
area
of
the
grill
and
use
separate
utensils
to
cook
.

they
do
n't
just
dump
your
ingredients
on
and
cook
either
,
but
carefully
separate
meat
to
the
hotter
parts
of
the
grill
and
still
manage
to
keep
the
veggies
from
turning
to
mush
.

the
selection
of
meats
,
veggies
and
sauces
is
awesome
too
!

every
time
we
go
they
seem
to
have
a
different
ingredient
or
two
which
keeps
things
interesting
.

meats
are
kept
very
cold
,
seafood
smells
fresh
and
the
serving
bar
is
very
clean
.

prices
are
reasonable
,
(
kid
s
meals
are
around
4.99
)
and
wednesday's
they
have
discount
dinner
prices
,
i
believe
.

great
cookies
,
cakes
,
and
customer
service

it
was
my
birthday
and
i
had
a
last
minute
idea
to
have
a
bakery
cake
instead
of
one
pre-made
in
a
convenience
store
,
but
the
problem
was
it
was
the
day
before
valentine
s
and
when
many
bakeries
turned
me
down
for
a
plain
vanilla
rectangle
cake
,
fiona
stepped
up
to
the
plate
and
was
able
to
make
a
fantastic
beautiful
cake
.

not
only
did
it
taste
wonderful
,
but
the
texture
was
unbelievable
,
the
frosting
was
n't
overly
sweet
to
over
power
the
cake
,
and
the
cake
itself
was
just
amazingly
soft
,
and
fluffy
,
and
just
perfect
overall
.

although
i
'll
have
to
drive
a
little
out
of
my
way
to
go
there
,
i
'll
gladly
do
it
knowing
that
since
she
's
been
astounding
to
me
once
before
that
she
'll
always
be
that
way
!

(
also
she
has
a
really
great
website
!

and
we
bought
a
few
cookies
there
too
,
they
were
fantastic
as
well
!
)

she
deserves
many
5
star
reviews
!!

food
craving
gone
and
weight
loss
at
acupuncture
doctor

i
am
a
college
student
.

before
treatment
,
my
food
cravings
were
"
out
of
control
"
which
caused
me
to
be
stressed
out
.

i
experienced
a
definite
decrease
in
food
craving
(
about
50
%
)
and
decrease
in
stress
after
the
1st
treatment
.

i
actually
loss
4
pounds
after
my
1st
treatment
and
2
pounds
after
my
2nd
treatment
.

i
was
amazed
.

i
am
now
more
at
peace
and
my
food
craving
is
about
99
%
gone
after
only
3
treatments
.

before
coming
to
acupuncture
doctor
i
was
a
big
baby
about
needles
and
only
came
because
my
boyfriend
's
aunt
recommended
it
.

it
hurt
very
little
,
felt
more
like
pressure
than
pain
.

what
i
like
most
about
dr.
liau
is
that
she
is
very
caring
.

she
talks
to
you
at
each
appointment
.

i
can
tell
she
really
cares
and
wants
to
help
.

i
am
so
glad
to
have
found
dr.
liau
.

now
i
feel
more
confident
wearing
my
bathing
suit
in
the
summer
.

an
asset
to
richmond

for
a
long
time
,
one
big
source
of
entertainment
missing
from
the
richmond
city
limits
was
a
first
-
run
multiplex
.

bowtie
has
filled
that
role
nicely
.

the
theatre
is
in
an
old
brick
warehouse
,
which
is
a
block
away
from
the
flying
squirrels
stadium
.

the
owners
of
bowtie
manged
to
add
something
new
while
preserving
what
was
already
there
.

the
theatre
has
greatly
improved
the
surrounding
neighborhood
.

there
's
plenty
of
parking
,
and
i
've
never
had
an
issue
with
audience
members
who
wo
n't
stop
talking
or
answering
their
cellphones
.

best
of
all
,
there
are
no
ads
!!!!
!

just
previews
and
the
main
feature
.

expect
to
pay
full
price
,
and
the
theatres
themselves
are
on
the
small
side
.

but
if
you
like
going
to
the
movies
,
you
should
love
bowtie
.

the
mangers
also
play
a
classic
movies
on
sundays
,
you
can
get
a
beer
in
the
lobby
,
and
repeat
customers
can
get
discounts
if
they
have
a
member
card
.

a
great
cinema
in
a
great
location
.

thank
you
,
bowtie
!

craft
wonderland
with
history

my
first
visit
was
so
fun
yesterday
.

i
could
have
stayed
all
day
and
not
seen
all
the
things
.

i
am
doing
origami
jewelry
and
found
exactly
the
right
things
for
earrings
and
got
many
other
ideas
there
too
.

i
bought
a
beginner
s
quilling
set
and
like
making
the
filigree
forms
you
can
make
and
add
to
other
crafts
.

the
owner
,
jean
,
has
been
there
31
years
!

what
a
history
.

she
is
a
super
sweet
,
lovable
and
well
-
informed
woman
with
a
great
sense
of
humor
.

i
really
enjoyed
meeting
her
and
happy
to
learn
she
comes
from
oklahoma
and
has
the
values
of
a
solid
no
bs
country
girl
.

this
store
is
a
real
gem
and
has
much
to
offer
the
serious
crafter
or
the
occasional
crafter
.

by
the
way
,
salmagundi
(
the
store
name
)
means
something
like
smorgasbord
;
potpourri
;
motley
;
variety
;
mixed
bag
;
miscellaneous
assortment
;
mixture
,
a
variety
of
many
kinds
of
things
.

great
name
for
a
great
store

the
2010
genesis
is
grrrrrrrreeeaaat
!

i
am
a
proud
owner
of
a
brand
new
2010
hyundai
genesis
.

i
have
never
seen
this
car
before
until
this
lady
at
wal
mart
had
it
and
she
told
me
she
got
it
here
and
that
everyone
was
so
nice
to
her
.

i
asked
her
who
she
worked
with
and
she
just
told
me
ti
was
the
sales
manager
.

i
took
the
weekend
off
and
came
in
and
asked
for
the
manager
who
is
jeff
and
he
remembered
her
right
away
even
remembered
her
dog
,
i
was
a
bit
shocked
that
someone
would
pay
that
close
attention
.

we
got
to
talking
and
he
got
me
set
up
and
i
test
drove
with
craig
and
i
fell
head
over
heels
for
this
car
all
i
kept
saying
,
"
was
i
got
ta
have
it
!
"

i
thouhgt
it
would
be
out
of
my
price
range
but
they
really
worked
with
me
and
now
i
could
nt
be
happier
.

jeff
and
craig
are
really
good
at
what
they
do
and
know
exactly
how
to
treat
a
customer
.

definitely
go
see
them
!

bait
and
switch
,
untrained
workers

called
the
bonanza
store
2
weeks
ago
,
before
i
ripped
out
350
sq
ft
of
ceramic
tile
...
was
told
i
would
need
a
"
dual
head
concrete
grinder
"
to
remove
thinset
and
make
a
nice
"
finished
"
look
(
ready
for
concrete
stain
)
.

was
quoted
$
55
all
inclusive
of
grinder
inserts
,
etc
.

no
problem
,
sounded
like
it
's
done
every
day
.

will
look
beautiful
.

got
the
tile
ripped
out
,
call
today
,
now
all
the
sudden
this
grinder
wo
n't
leave
a
finished
look
and
it
's
$
125
plus
around
$
75
for
the
inserts
.

i
can
rent
another
machine
for
like
$
60
that
will
give
it
a
finished
look
.

so
from
$
55
to
$
260
?

are
they
serious
?

i
feel
like
they
did
n't
tell
me
the
pitfalls
before
i
pulled
out
this
tile
and
now
that
i
have
no
other
options
they
want
5
times
the
price
?

either
these
people
do
n't
know
anything
about
what
they
are
renting
,
or
worse
-
they
are
bait
and
switching
.

one
suspects
that
earlier
reviewer
works
for
another
laundry
.

outside
of
parking
being
at
a
premium
,
especially
on
discount
days
,
the
laundry
tub
is
not
filthy
and
it
's
no
smaller
than
any
of
a
dozen
laundromats
i
've
been
in
.

yes
,
there
are
bigger
,
but
bigger
is
n't
necessarily
better
.

i
availed
myself
of
the
wash
'n
fold
service
,
taking
just
about
a
year
's
worth
of
dirty
clothes
in
and
getting
back
neatly
folded
,
clean
clothes
in
clear
plastic
bags
(
i
'd
originally
brought
them
in
,
in
six
large
yellow
garbage
bags
)
.

the
cost
was
certainly
reasonable
and
i
will
continue
my
patronage
of
the
laundry
tub
in
the
future
.

did
n't
hurt
any
that
they
knew
my
name
by
my
second
visit
and
greeted
me
warmly
then
and
on
my
third
visit
.

whereas
my
answer
to
the
question
"
where
do
you
get
your
laundry
done
?
"
used
to
be
,
"
at
the
checkout
line
at
walmart
,
"
i
can
honestly
say
the
answer
now
is
,
"
at
the
laundry
tub
.
"

thank
you
!

i
recently
took
a
rescue
puppy
to
this
clinic
and
i
was
shocked
at
how
well
romeo
and
my
family
was
treated
.

they
worked
around
the
clock
to
ensure
that
my
puppy
life
was
saved
.

we
have
to
leave
him
at
the
vet
for
3
days
and
i
was
told
to
call
for
check
ups
as
often
as
i
wished
that
no
matter
how
many
times
i
called
i
would
not
annoy
them
.

lol
they
where
super
friendly
towards
us
and
treated
us
like
people
not
walking
bags
of
cash
.

in
this
day
it
s
rare
to
find
such
wonderful
people
who
care
,
not
the
kind
of
want
to
make
cash
.

i
would
strongly
suggest
you
give
them
the
chance
to
prove
to
you
that
not
all
people
in
this
world
are
evil
!

i
will
never
go
to
another
vet
as
long
as
i
have
animals
.

i
live
nearly
two
hours
away
and
yet
i
will
still
make
the
drive
to
see
them
!

in
fact
i
look
forward
to
taking
my
animals
to
the
vet
simply
because
of
how
my
animals
and
i
are
treated
.

okay
,
here
's
the
scoop
.

i
'm
a
regular
at
the
hh
.

the
food
is
excellent
,
the
serivce
is
horrible
.

i
think
they
're
still
in
the
mindset
from
when
it
was
only
smokers
sitting
around
and
drinking
...
not
in
any
hurry
.

in
my
experience
the
food
has
been
excellent
(
for
the
most
part
)
.

however
,
the
bartenders
/
waitresses
definately
need
to
be
re-trained
(
if
they
ever
had
any
to
begin
with
)
and
learn
two
things
:
only
chat
with
customers
when
other
customers
are
not
impatiently
waiting
and
to
look
around
more
often
to
see
if
people
are
waiting
.

in
some
cases
the
result
is
because
of
understaffing
,
in
some
cases
the
staff
just
does
n't
care
/
know
better
.

they
must
also
get
something
to
keep
take
-
out
warm
,
so
it
's
not
room
temperature
at
best
when
you
get
it
home
.

you
just
have
to
know
what
you
're
getting
into
when
you
go
.

nice
local
pub
,
excellent
food
(
especially
wings
)
,
and
do
n't
go
if
you
have
a
limited
amount
of
time
.

trust
the
midas
touch

i
personally
trust
this
midas
store
with
all
my
vehicles
,
i
have
been
going
there
for
years
&
would
never
go
anywhere
else
!

the
staff
is
very
personable
&
actually
care
about
the
customers
safety
rather
than
taking
there
money
.

this
is
however
a
very
busy
shop
but
there
are
appointments
available
&
the
staff
up
front
will
surely
make
sure
you
get
back
in
a
timely
manner
.

i
look
at
some
of
these
other
comments
&
laugh
because
people
think
that
the
world
revolves
around
them
!

like
the
girl
with
the
fuse
problem
...

midas
has
the
most
high
tech
equipment
in
town
&
i
guarantee
you
if
they
told
you
it
was
electrical
then
in
deed
it
s
electrical
!

maybe
you
should
understand
how
the
world
works
&
realize
you
are
just
like
any
other
person
&
not
put
yourself
on
a
pedestal
.

i
will
continue
going
to
dave
at
midas
because
he
is
one
of
the
most
honest
business
owners
in
this
town
!

when
having
your
car
worked
on
you
have
to
trust
the
mechanic
&
this
midas
is
truly
someone
you
can
trust
!

we
decided
to
try
this
place
last
night
because
we
noticed
that
it
had
some
interesting
things
on
the
menu
aside
from
the
usual
rolls
--
live
scallop
sashimi
,
duck
breast
nigiri
with
foie
gras
,
panko
mussels
--
but
none
of
these
were
particularly
great
or
worth
the
sticker
price
.

additionally
we
tried
the
logan
circle
roll
,
spicy
crab
and
tuna
roll
,
and
sweet
potato
tempura
roll
(
$
15
,
$
10
,
and
$
3.75
respectively
)
.

the
sweet
potato
tempura
roll
was
actually
a
great
surprise
:
cheap
and
delicious
,
the
only
thing
we
tried
that
i
would
say
was
well
worth
it
and
a
great
value
(
and
i
never
get
vegetarian
rolls
)
.

the
other
rolls
were
n't
at
all
special
,
especially
given
their
pricing
.

the
bottom
line
is
that
the
food
is
n't
great
and
is
relatively
high
-
priced
.

the
service
is
solicitous
,
the
atmosphere
is
nice
and
mod
except
the
out
-
of
-
place
flat
-
screen
tv
playing
football
.

but
i
'd
go
elsewhere
unless
the
prices
are
cut
.

it
's
just
not
worth
it
.

do
n't
expect
sleep
or
courtesy

i
was
booked
for
2
nights
at
this
hotel
in
oct
2007
.

at
3:15
am
on
night
2
,
the
fire
alarm
and
strobe
light
activated
in
my
room
.

these
are
not
household
type
alarms
.

when
they
sound
off
,
it
is
a
true
audio
/
visual
experience
.

i
called
the
front
desk
and
got
no
answer
.

after
checking
for
signs
of
fire
or
smoke
and
seeing
none
,
i
decided
to
just
pack
up
and
leave
.

the
desk
agent
actually
argued
with
me
,
claiming
that
no
such
alarm
had
gone
off
(
as
if
i
would
make
that
up
?
)
.

he
finally
admitted
that
only
the
4
ada
room
alarms
had
sounded
,
so
only
4
guests
were
effected
(
no
big
deal
to
him
)
.

this
little
drip
offered
no
apologies
whatsoever
,
and
even
refused
to
give
me
the
name
of
the
manager
until
i
pressed
him
for
it
3
times
.

this
hotel
is
adequate
enough
,
but
there
is
an
obvious
problem
with
the
staff
and
management
.

do
not
go
there
if
you
expect
to
sleep
through
the
night
.

poor
service
,
lack
of
passion
:
do
not
go

i
began
seeing
dr.
romanick
back
in
2000
and
have
seen
a
significant
decline
in
the
quality
of
care
,
patient
-
doctor
communication
,
and
just
the
overall
level
of
services
.

the
poor
quality
starts
at
the
receptionist
desk
,
where
the
staff
is
very
impatient
and
lack
the
efficiency
i
once
loved
about
the
office
.

it
took
them
nearly
two
months
to
complete
a
simple
task
,
and
countless
calls
from
my
part
due
to
their
lack
of
response
and
passion
(
not
that
it
's
a
requirement
for
the
job
,
but
it
helps
to
at
least
pretend
to
be
helpful
)
.

also
,
i
was
promised
to
have
my
test
results
emailed
to
me
,
but
it
never
happened
,
and
after
a
few
attempts
to
get
dr.
romanick
on
the
phone
to
brief
me
on
my
condition
,
i
finally
gave
up
and
went
to
a
different
doctor
.

please
do
not
go
there
if
it
's
professional
,
friendly
,
diligent
medical
services
you
're
looking
for
.

save
yourself
the
trouble
,
money
and
time
and
visit
a
more
caring
facility
/
doctor
.

the
moving
company
is
actualy
based
in
brooklyn
,
but
advertised
all
over
ny
/
nj
,
including
fort
lee
.

when
the
guys
arrived
(
2
hours
later
than
agreed
)
they
told
that
you
have
to
pay
all
the
tolls
they
payed
coming
from
brooklyn
and
extra
$
100
for
them
to
drive
back
from
your
destination
.

that
was
not
in
agreement
eather
,
but
they
realy
demand
it
.

and
another
$
100
for
wrapping
the
furniture
.

so
totalling
$
212
just
for
start
before
any
work
started
.

guess
what
,
was
not
in
the
initial
agreement
as
well
.

i
was
moving
out
from
2
bdr
apartment
and
it
took
for
3
strong
guys
6
hours
to
load
a
track
(
from
2
pm
-
8
pm
)
.

the
only
reason
i
'm
giving
3
stars
instead
of
1
or
2
,
i
should
admit
,
nothing
was
broken
.

so
i
still
can
recomend
them
but
prepare
pay
twice
as
much
as
they
tell
you
initially
.

one
more
thing
,
they
do
n't
take
any
credit
cards
or
checks
.

you
have
to
pay
cash
only
before
they
start
unloading
track
on
your
destination
.

worst
apartments
ever

we
lived
here
for
2
years
,
the
first
year
or
so
was
okay
.

then
,
the
more
power
they
gave
to
linda
,
the
worse
the
place
got
.

we
were
always
having
our
water
shut
off
,
there
were
always
people
having
parties
at
the
pool
,
even
after
it
was
supposed
to
be
closed
.

the
pool
was
supposed
to
close
at
10
and
they
would
have
people
down
there
until
11:45
yelling
,
playing
music
and
do
who
-
knows
-
what
in
the
dark
corners
of
the
pool
.

then
,
when
we
moved
out
,
we
cleaned
the
apartment
top
to
bottom
,
they
came
back
and
tried
to
charge
us
for
two
cleaning
fees
(
and
we
never
got
our
deposit
back
)
and
past
utilities
(
that
were
already
paid
,
we
have
check
numbers
and
records
of
this
)
.

linda
is
the
rudest
person
you
will
ever
talk
to
and
she
sticks
up
for
all
of
the
trashy
,
rude
people
that
live
there
,
not
the
nice
ones
that
actually
give
a
crap
about
respecting
others
.

do
not
live
here
,
you
will
regret
it
!

the
worst
experience
ever
!!!

i
have
worked
with
ted
jurek
at
decor
and
you
,
and
it
started
out
as
a
decent
experience
.

he
was
referred
to
me
by
a
friend
,
who
did
n't
have
the
best
experience
with
ted
,
but
said
that
ted
was
able
to
make
up
for
his
lack
of
preparedness
at
the
end
.

i
figure
i
would
give
this
company
a
chance
.

however
,
after
giving
a
required
$
500.00
(
non
refundable
)
deposit
before
seeing
any
plans
or
ideas
,
i
was
sorry
i
did
.

we
met
a
couple
of
weeks
later
,
ted
was
late
.

he
brought
fabric
books
,
and
pictures
of
furniture
only
,
which
all
came
way
over
budget
.

by
the
time
we
got
to
the
budget
i
told
him
i
could
work
with
,
there
was
basically
no
design
.

just
curtains
and
a
couple
of
accessories
.

what
is
that
?????

this
company
is
way
too
expensive
with
nothing
to
show
for
it
.

please
everyone
....
take
heed
and
do
n't
get
caught
up
in
the
hype
about
decor
and
you
working
with
every
budget
...

this
is
just
a
way
for
them
to
squirm
their
way
into
your
precious
pocket

horrible
.

horrible
.

when
we
walked
in
,
the
person
behind
desk
said
:
"
oh
well
,
you
must
wait
,
i
am
in
the
middle
of
something
.
"

after
a
good
few
minutes
,
he
asked
:
"
what
do
you
want
?
"

somewhere
in
between
his
rudeness
he
asked
if
we
smoked
.

i
asked
if
this
hotel
had
smoking
rooms
.

he
immediately
said
"
no
,
there
is
a
$
50
deposit
now
!
"

sure
enough
he
charged
it
to
the
credit
card
.

when
i
inquired
he
rudely
replied
"
in
the
morning
when
things
are
checked
out
you
'll
get
it
back
.
"

i
called
customer
service
about
it
because
the
website
specifically
states
that
there
are
no
other
charges
at
the
check
-
in
.

i
also
mentioned
to
the
reception
person
.

he
responded
"
we
have
problem
with
'
people
'
"
.

imagine
a
hotel
having
problems
with
people
.

i
finally
alerted
him
to
his
rudeness
.

he
said
he
's
had
a
long
and
bad
day
.

we
had
no
choice
but
to
stay
but
will
take
this
as
far
as
we
can
.

do
n't
stay
there
.

i
came
to
find
out
the
person
was
the
hotel
owner
also
.

my
friend
and
i
were
to
stay
here
for
a
girls
night
,
catch
up
on
our
lives
evening
.

we
live
within
20
miles
of
the
hotel
and
wanted
to
get
away
from
our
responsibilities
for
the
night
.

unfortunalty
my
husband
and
i
had
to
put
our
13
year
old
lab
down
that
morning
and
we
were
not
expecting
this
.

my
friend
called
the
hotel
to
cancel
our
room
as
soon
as
i
called
her
.

they
said
that
we
were
to
be
charged
for
this
room
regardless
because
we
did
not
cancel
within
the
72
hours
.

i
called
them
back
a
few
hours
after
putting
my
bodhi
down
and
they
still
would
n't
budge
.

times
are
hard
,
i
know
,
but
they
had
no
compassion
.

i
called
3
times
to
talked
to
a
manager
,
never
a
call
back
.

i
emailed
4
times
,
never
a
response
.

in
one
of
the
emails
i
attached
the
letter
from
the
vet
's
that
expressed
their
sympathy
,
this
hotel
did
nothing
.

i
even
emailed
mackinaw
tourist
and
nothing
.

i
am
sure
this
is
a
good
place
to
stay
from
reading
the
other
reviews
,
but
if
something
unexpected
happens
in
your
life
,
they
will
not
care
.

fanfuckingtastic

ok
i
am
a
new
yorker
who
has
been
going
to
school
in
oxford
,
england
.

i
thought
the
uk
was
completely
devoid
of
good
nyc
style
pizza
.

i
thought
to
get
a
decent
pizza
the
only
way
was
at
a
fancy
restaurant
,
and
i
have
to
get
a
whole
pie
.

i
thought
i
would
have
to
wait
until
i
went
home
to
nyc
.

well
then
i
went
on
a
trip
to
glasgow
and
was
walking
around
.

i
saw
this
place
and
it
looked
like
the
holy
grail
.

i
knew
i
had
found
the
real
deal
,
big
pies
,
sold
by
the
slice
,
with
the
pizzas
sitting
under
the
glass
in
the
front
.

they
have
crushed
red
pepper
flakes
and
oregano
.

so
i
ordered
a
slice
.

it
tasted
like
i
just
flew
back
home
.

i
du
n
no
how
they
did
it
,
but
scottish
friends
---
this
is
the
real
deal
.

i
congratulated
this
establishment
for
doing
the
research
on
making
nyc
pizza
because
these
scots
fcking
nailed
it
.

that
being
said
,
i
do
n't
know
how
their
delivery
service
is
.

they
might
want
to
change
the
name
to
reflect
the
new
yorkedness
of
the
pizza
,
scrummy
yummy
sounds
gimmicky
to
me
.

good
food
,
good
wait
staff
,
poor
management

we
visited
on
7/26/08
for
dinner
we
received
a
gift
certificate
for
the
mama
mia
's
on
greenfield
ave
.

the
food
was
good
,
and
so
was
our
waitress
.

when
it
came
time
to
pay
the
bill
up
front
,
they
would
not
let
me
use
any
of
the
certificate
for
a
tip
(
which
i
have
done
with
any
other
restaurant
i
've
gotten
a
gift
certificate
for
.
)

i
then
asked
if
i
could
have
money
back
in
cash
.

the
person
went
to
go
check
with
the
manager
,
who
was
sitting
at
a
table
chatting
with
her
friends
who
were
eating
there
.

her
answer
was
short
and
manner
rather
rude
.

sorry
for
interrupting
i
guess
.

the
cashier
was
also
short
,
unapologetic
and
made
me
feel
as
i
was
wasting
her
time
.

there
were
no
other
options
available
(
i
only
brought
my
check
card
to
cover
any
overage
cost
)
and
she
rang
it
up
and
applied
it
to
the
gift
card
before
telling
me
about
the
tip
policy
.

i
will
not
be
visiting
mama
mia
's
again
.

there
are
other
places
with
food
just
as
good
with
management
that
values
customers
and
employees
much
more
.

dining
at
texas
roadhouse

texas
roadhouse
has
very
good
meals
,
that
the
meat
comes
right
off
the
bones
.

it
has
very
good
prices
.

on
a
bad
note
the
waiting
area
is
not
enjoyable
or
enough
seats
.

also
,
there
should
not
be
peanuts
all
over
the
floor
.

next
,
there
should
only
be
one
person
bringing
you
your
food
.

it
s
not
a
big
deal
but
i
had
to
take
my
salad
home
because
they
forgot
to
bring
it
.

i
had
to
ask
the
girl
who
brought
my
food
and
she
never
came
back
to
let
me
know
.

i
had
to
wait
for
my
waitress
.

when
you
first
come
in
the
hostess
is
not
very
friendly
,
there
is
just
a
bunch
of
workers
standing
there
.

i
was
there
on
march
6th
,
2009
.

i
was
also
there
of
july
4th
2008
,
when
my
daughter
s
buffalo
wings
came
out
with
a
fly
on
it
.

the
manager
came
over
and
said
he
was
sorry
and
gave
a
new
batch
of
wings
,
he
said
we
ca
nt
really
do
anything
because
the
doors
are
always
opening
and
closing
.

in
my
opinion
should
of
just
took
off
the
price
of
the
wings
from
the
bill
.

but
everyone
has
there
own
way
!!!!!!

mezza
luna
ftw
!

their
mezza
luna's
are
deffly
better
than
the
pizza
rolls
.

it
s
like
a
pizza
roll
,
but
they
just
toss
ham
and
cheese
inside
.

it
seems
like
it
s
healthier
too
,
but
it
s
prolly
not
.

also
,
you
can
call
em
ahead
of
time
,
and
then
go
to
pick
up
ur
food
,
or
have
it
delivered
**
.

that
cuts
down
on
teh
wait
time
,
cus
u
can
do
other
stuff
while
u
r
waiting
.

it
usually
takes
20
mins
for
a
mezza
luna
,
as
they
have
to
add
pure
delicious
extract
to
the
mix
.

their
pizza
was
a
little
salty
for
me
,
but
it
s
still
good
.

they
do
that
whole
thing
where
you
sandwich
the
pepperoni
between
layers
of
cheese
for
+
32
delicious
.

anyways
,
the
mezza
luna
:
you
should
try
it
.

it
runs
you
about
4
bucks
and
it
deals
crushing
blows
to
hunger
.

**
edit
:
living
on
campus
at
clarkson
university
,
i
have
had
food
delivered
before
.

this
was
back
between
'05
and
'09
and
i
do
n't
remember
how
many
times
we
've
had
it
delivered
.

perhaps
they
do
n't
deliver
anymore
,
but
the
deliciousness
of
a
mezza
luna
certainly
warrants
a
pickup
.

my
2004
x
-
type
was
getting
close
to
100,000
miles
so
it
was
time
for
an
upgrade
.

i
sent
my
wife
and
daughter
over
to
check
out
a
pre-owned
2009
xf
.

michael
chestney
was
very
pleasant
and
patient
with
my
wife
and
she
suggested
i
go
check
it
out
.

i
went
in
later
that
afternoon
and
met
with
michael
.

he
showed
me
the
car
i
was
interested
in
and
we
took
a
test
drive
.

i
loved
the
car
so
we
began
negotiating
my
trade
-
in
and
the
price
of
the
09
xf
.

the
entire
negotiation
took
about
20
minutes
.

fair
give
and
take
on
both
sides
until
we
agreed
on
a
deal
that
was
within
my
parameters
and
was
fair
to
both
sides
.

10
minutes
of
paperwork
and
i
was
the
owner
of
a
beautiful
pre-owned
09
xf
.

i
have
purchased
over
15
vehicles
(
cars
,
rvs
,
and
boats
)
in
my
lifetime
and
i
have
to
say
the
experience
with
michael
and
barrett
motor
cars
of
san
antonio
was
one
of
the
best
.

friendly
,
knowledgeable
,
and
above
all
fair
.

that
's
all
you
can
really
ask
from
a
car
dealer
and
michael
and
barrett
hit
all
3
.

thanks
for
the
great
deal
and
the
great
car
!

identity
theft

myself
and
my
fiance
's
identity
was
stolen
from
the
office
staff
.

we
were
told
by
a
detective
and
asked
to
check
our
credit
for
anything
unusual
.

luckily
they
caught
the
crooks
before
they
did
one
on
us
.

it
was
a
black
female
that
use
to
work
in
the
office
.

she
stole
the
information
and
gave
it
to
another
guy
that
did
all
the
work
.

the
other
guy
was
pulled
over
one
day
and
a
cop
saw
suspicious
papers
with
names
and
social
security
numbers
on
it
.

that
s
how
they
were
caught
.

they
both
went
to
jail
and
a
new
manager
was
put
in
charge
of
the
apartments
.

the
apartment
across
from
mine
belonged
to
a
gang
of
hookers
.

nobody
lived
there
.

a
girl
would
show
up
,
then
a
guy
in
a
nice
car
would
show
up
.

short
time
later
the
guy
would
leave
,
then
the
girl
.

my
apartment
was
usually
quiet
.

i
lived
in
one
that
did
not
face
the
parking
lot
.

parking
spaces
are
just
big
enough
for
a
mini
cooper
.

it
sucked
having
an
suv
.

if
i
found
a
spot
,
i
could
nt
fit
in
it
.

gates
worked
30
%
of
the
time
at
best
.

bugs
were
a
small
problem
,
nothing
too
bad
.

the
best
there
is
in
service
.

i
was
recently
traveling
down
i
-
24
from
nashville
with
my
3
young
children
and
had
a
blowout
on
the
southeast
side
of
murfreesboro
.

it
was
4:50
when
a
friend
told
me
to
call
bud
,
he
would
take
care
of
me
.

not
only
did
they
answer
the
phone
at
4:50
on
a
thursday
,
they
hit
the
ground
moving
!.

they
tracked
down
the
only
tire
that
fit
my
bmw
330i
in
murfreesboro
within
minutes
and
secured
it
,
then
they
came
out
,
took
off
my
tire
(
it
was
a
runflat
-
but
runflats
do
n't
do
you
any
good
if
they
blow
out
)
,
and
brought
it
to
their
shop
to
change
the
tire
.

they
were
back
quickly
considering
how
far
outside
of
murfreesboro
we
were
and
had
us
on
our
way
by
6:30
that
evening
.

thanks
bud
for
all
of
your
help
and
taking
time
away
from
your
family
that
evening
.

it
's
without
a
doubt
,
the
best
service
experience
i
've
ever
had
and
just
to
be
clear
,
the
price
he
charged
me
was
the
same
as
my
tire
guy
in
nashville
's
price
for
putting
on
the
other
rear
tire
.

i
hope
i
can
return
the
favor
in
the
future
!

alan
grissom

room
ok
.

service
and
client
base
not
ok
.

i
have
stayed
in
this
hotel
many
times
,
and
while
it
typically
offers
a
decent
bang
for
the
buck
,
its
client
base
largely
consists
of
troubled
youngsteers
and
evictees
from
the
local
,
not
so
pleasant
hood
.

i
have
never
considered
this
a
real
problem
as
i
travel
without
kids
and
can
fend
for
myself
,
but
when
i
had
to
listen
to
a
(
non-violent
)
domestic
fight
that
lasted
from
1
am
to
5
am
during
my
last
stay
and
i
found
out
that
the
front
desk
was
unmanned
during
night
hours
,
my
choice
was
to
either
waste
tax
payers
money
by
calling
for
a
yet
another
police
dispatch
to
this
hotel
,
or
just
get
over
it
.

i
chose
the
later
,
but
approached
the
front
desk
about
the
hotel
policy
to
push
over
their
responsibilities
on
local
authorities
,
not
to
mention
the
good
night
s
sleep
i
paid
for
but
did
nt
get
.

i
was
told
management
would
call
me
back
but
still
waiting
for
that
call
.

i
will
probably
stay
here
again
because
it
s
cheap
and
i
ca
nt
afford
a
better
hotel
,
but
do
not
look
forward
to
it
and
would
definitely
not
recommend
this
hotel
for
families
or
single
female
travellers
.

was
there
this
past
weekend
and
the
guy
behind
the
counter
yelled
at
me
and
my
son
because
we
believed
he
left
the
grandma
slice
in
the
oven
a
little
too
long
and
the
cheese
got
all
dried
out
and
the
slice
tasted
more
like
a
cracker
.

he
preceded
to
grab
the
slice
off
the
countertop
and
throw
it
into
the
trash
while
yelling
at
me
saying
,
"
you
do
not
order
what
you
do
not
know
about
"
and
"
you
do
n't
know
how
pizza
is
made
"
.

it
was
very
upsetting
to
see
this
kind
of
behavior
especially
in
front
of
my
four
year
old
.

he
was
in
the
process
of
making
me
a
pie
and
when
i
got
home
,
the
pie
was
the
worst
i
have
ever
seen
.

cheese
was
falling
off
,
so
oily
and
greasy
.

i
think
he
did
it
on
purpose
because
of
my
simple
request
for
another
slice
of
grandma
that
was
n't
so
well
-
done
(
actually
,
burnt
)
.

i
will
never
go
back
to
this
place
and
i
am
reporting
them
to
the
better
business
bureau
for
such
horrible
customer
relations
and
basically
sabotaging
my
pizza
and
taking
my
$
25
.

this
story
is
100
%
true
.

that
little
man
who
thinks
he
invented
pizza
can
kiss
my
*ss
.

long
lines
,
silly
rules
,
rude
staff
,
ok
food

the
first
thing
you
notice
when
you
arrive
on
location
is
that
the
waiting
line
literally
goes
out
the
door
and
spills
into
the
parking
lot
.

a
restaurant
with
this
many
patrons
willing
to
stand
in
line
just
to
order
tacos
must
be
good
,
right
?

i
mean
,
that
's
the
way
it
works
at
amusement
parks
:
the
longest
lines
are
at
the
best
rides
.

well
,
this
may
be
an
exception
.

the
staff
taking
your
order
and
"
waiting
"
on
you
are
very
indifferent
and
have
no
sense
of
costumer
service
at
all
.

i
have
gotten
better
results
talking
to
comcast
customer
service
than
with
these
folks
.

and
do
n't
even
think
about
asking
to
speak
to
the
manager
because
this
guy
is
,
and
pardon
my
french
,
a
jerk
.

if
you
have
gotten
through
ordering
,
dealing
with
the
rude
staff
and
if
you
followed
the
dumb
rules
,
you
are
finally
presented
with
what
you
came
for
..
some
tacos
that
are
"
ok
,
"
but
definitely
not
worth
putting
up
with
all
the
hassle
.

save
yourself
the
trouble
and
skip
this
place
all
together
.

i
suggest
you
go
up
to
raging
taco
&
raging
burrito
a
couple
of
blocks
up
the
street
or
even
taco
mac
.

wish
this
was
in
saratoga
--

we
were
introduced
to
bistro
tallulah
by
traveler
-
professional
diner
who
happens
to
own
the
adelphi
hotel
and
travels
the
world
--
and
residing
in
paris
,
london
,
new
york
the
rest
of
the
year
.

she
knows
great
food
and
dining
experiences
.

she
was
dead
on
--
this
restaurant
was
wonderful
---
do
not
be
put
off
by
the
one
negative
review
on
this
page
.

i
can
tell
you
we
were
pleasantly
surprised
--
bt
has
taste
memory
and
each
time
back
the
food
was
consistently
delicious
--
same
dishes
--
were
consistent
.

our
friend
is
a
world
traveler
and
loves
unpretentious
dining
experiences
and
inspired
food
.

this
chef
knows
what
he
is
doing
.

treat
yourself
and
go
--
you
will
go
back
!

i
am
a
business
owner
in
downtown
saratoga
springs
and
wish
this
restaurant
was
in
our
town
!

the
affordable
rent
makes
it
possible
for
an
inspired
chef
to
serve
his
high
quality
fare
at
affordable
prices
!

unlike
saratoga
.

i
rrly
seek
the
cehf
out
to
introduce
myself
--
but
the
second
time
we
went
--
i
made
a
point
of
asking
our
wait
person
to
introduce
my
friend
and
myself
to
the
chef
to
tell
him
just
how
good
our
meals
were
.

can
not
wait
to
go
gain
.

i
think
that
the
re
pretty
good
.

first
of
all
,
if
you
call
for
an
appointment
they
wo
n't
tell
you
to
call
back
a
month
later
so
you
can
then
make
one
.

they
also
do
n't
tell
you
that
they
're
going
to
mail
you
an
"
application
"
to
be
admitted
to
be
a
patient
.

i
feel
that
the
way
some
doctor
s
offices
work
around
here
is
a
little
bit
absurd
so
i
'm
happy
that
these
guys
do
n't
do
those
two
things
in
particlular
.

usually
you
can
be
seen
the
same
week
or
maybe
the
following
week
.

the
doctor
did
tell
me
that
my
male
pattern
baldness
is
due
to
my
mother
s
father
because
the
gene
is
exclusively
passed
on
through
maternal
line
but
that
's
a
common
misconception
(
http://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-living/beauty-personal-care/hair-loss-10-08/hair-loss.htm
)
.

in
general
i
would
say
that
the
staff
is
attentive
and
nice
.

but
then
again
i
was
nice
to
them
so
that
could
have
been
why
.

anyhow
,
after
reading
some
of
the
other
reviews
it
seems
like
some
of
the
other
reviewers
are
expecting
mircles
.

if
you
want
miracles
you
'll
have
to
go
to
21st
st
.

it
's
a
pretty
typical
primary
care
office
but
for
the
area
it
's
very
good
.

they
do
n't
do
certain
things
that
are
really
annoying
about
other
offices
.

first
trip
to
canada

i
recently
traveled
to
canada
on
business
and
had
a
most
excellent
experience
.

i
work
for
a
large
retail
company
recently
expanding
our
operations
into
canada
and
had
to
travel
to
ensure
all
of
our
computer
network
equipment
was
installed
properly
and
on
time
.

this
can
tend
to
be
a
stressful
experience
in
itself
let
alone
adding
crossing
boarders
for
the
first
time
.

i
was
very
pleased
to
find
my
accommodations
and
the
hotel
staff
to
be
a
very
calming
and
comforting
part
of
my
trip
.

i
found
the
hotel
to
be
amazingly
clean
,
not
to
mention
very
well
adorned
with
many
pleasant
surprises
.

from
my
first
encounter
at
check
in
to
my
regrettable
check
out
i
found
the
staff
and
facility
to
exceed
my
expectation
.

i
completely
enjoyed
my
whole
check
in
experience
and
was
impressed
with
the
friendliness
and
professionalism
of
the
staff
as
well
as
the
accommodations
themselves
.

i
will
be
traveling
in
this
area
in
the
future
and
you
can
be
assured
that
this
experience
will
be
helpful
in
my
choice
of
hotels
and
novotel
will
be
my
first
selection
.

yes
the
parking
can
be
a
challenge
but
being
from
nj
i
am
no
stranger
to
tight
corners
.

please
pass
my
appreciation
to
the
staff
and
management
for
their
excellent
hospitality
and
good
spirits
as
it
helped
make
a
stressful
trip
enjoyable
.

favorite
place
in
tampa

update
:
i
had
to
add
to
my
review
.

i
was
just
in
last
night
and
had
a
chance
to
dine
in
their
new
dining
room
.

amazing
!

i
frequent
this
resturant
on
a
weekly
basis
but
usally
only
for
lunch
.

well
i
was
in
for
a
treat
when
i
was
greeted
by
the
friendly
girls
at
the
counter
who
asked
if
my
wife
and
i
would
like
to
sit
in
their
"
new
"
dining
room
.

right
away
they
told
us
that
it
was
the
same
great
food
with
the
same
prices
so
off
we
went
.

we
were
greeted
again
and
sat
promptly
.

after
looking
at
the
menu
and
seeing
the
new
menu
items
they
had
,
we
knew
we
were
in
for
a
treat
!

i
had
the
chicken
parmesan
dinner
and
my
wife
had
the
shrimp
scampi
dinner
.

amazing
!

the
portions
were
generous
enough
that
we
even
took
some
home
!

i
have
to
say
the
value
of
this
place
always
amazes
me
.

it
's
nice
to
see
that
even
in
the
economy
we
can
eat
a
place
that
has
upscale
service
,
amazing
atmosphere
,
and
incredible
food
,
but
not
break
the
bank
while
enjoying
it
!

bottom
line
is
that
when
it
's
a
small
privatly
owned
resturant
like
this
is
you
can
tell
that
the
owners
and
employees
take
pride
in
their
product
and
service
.

well
done
!

great
work
and
honest
establishment
!

i
typically
have
work
done
on
my
jeep
at
the
dealership
,
but
it
is
6
years
old
now
and
getting
charged
dealership
prices
just
did
n't
seem
cost
effective
anymore
.

i
had
tried
out
few
place
around
the
area
and
had
been
ripped
off
a
few
times
.

i
had
hear
great
things
about
phet
and
g&g
automotive
so
i
decided
to
give
him
a
try
.

the
service
was
excellent
and
personable
.

he
checked
out
what
i
needed
to
have
done
told
me
what
needed
be
fixed
before
he
did
any
work
and
did
great
repair
work
.

the
price
was
actually
lower
than
what
i
had
anticipated
and
used
to
compared
to
other
places
,
plus
he
showed
me
the
work
he
did
when
i
came
in
to
pick
up
the
car
.

also
,
a
week
after
the
work
,
phet
called
me
up
to
see
how
my
car
was
running
and
to
let
me
know
that
they
had
accidentally
overcharged
me
for
part
of
the
work
and
wanted
to
give
me
a
refund
for
that
amount
.

that
is
just
unheard
of
these
days
!

i
grew
up
in
a
small
town
where
you
knew
and
trusted
your
mechanic
and
was
really
cynical
about
city
auto
repair
shops
since
i
moved
here
,
but
phet
has
shown
that
there
really
are
honest
hard
working
mechanics
around
.

he
is
my
mechanic
going
forward
!

our
company
is
a
high
end
designer
handbag
and
fashion
accessories
company
,
thus
we
are
certainly
a
niche
market
.

we
had
been
evaluating
seo
providers
for
quite
some
time
and
finally
decided
to
take
the
plunge
with
stuart
,
and
ulistic
.

we
made
the
decision
for
a
couple
of
reasons
.

1
.
social
media
.

we
were
familiar
with
search
engine
optimization
strategies
,
but
new
nothing
about
social
media
-
we
just
heard
that
it
was
the
next
big
thing
.

2
.
we
really
liked
the
fact
that
stuart
sets
defined
objectives
and
we
meet
once
a
month
to
go
over
our
key
performance
indicators
.

how
has
it
gone
so
far
?

well
we
have
been
working
with
ulistic
for
1.5
months
,
and
have
100
people
following
our
site
on
facebook
,
and
our
web
site
,
www.designofashion.com
has
seen
a
3
fold
increase
in
traffic
,
which
is
significantly
beating
our
expectations
-
seo
is
a
process
that
takes
time
and
to
get
results
this
quickly
is
exceptional
.

we
are
absolutely
confident
that
stuart
's
ethical
and
focused
strategies
will
see
these
trends
continue
to
grow
,
and
our
business
will
reap
the
rewards
of
this
program
.

finally
,
it
must
be
said
that
stuart
is
a
fantastic
person
to
work
with
,
because
of
his
solid
strategies
and
equally
as
importantly
because
he
is
a
genuinely
good
person
and
a
great
communicator
.

excellent
service
and
quality

i
had
hom
-
excel
replace
most
of
the
windows
in
my
tampa
residence
three
years
ago
.

the
excellent
windows
have
performed
without
any
problems
,
but
that
's
not
why
i
'm
writing
my
review
.

three
weeks
ago
,
burglars
tried
to
gain
entry
into
the
rear
of
my
home
.

the
intruders
slit
the
screen
of
the
window
.

next
,
they
tried
to
force
the
window
with
a
pry
bar
and
then
to
break
the
window
with
a
hammer
.

the
window
did
n't
break
!

my
next
-
door
neighbor
heard
the
noise
and
turned
on
a
light
,
thankfully
scaring
the
two
miscreants
away
(
they
even
left
their
hammer
behind
!
)
.

i
called
home
-
excel
the
next
day
to
order
a
replacement
screen
for
the
window
,
and
was
happily
surprised
when
they
said
that
they
were
n't
even
going
to
charge
me
for
the
replacement
screen
...
that
it
would
be
covered
under
their
guarentee
.

lo
and
behold
,
they
replaced
the
screen
(
which
had
to
be
ordered
)
yesterday
and
did
n't
charge
me
a
dime
.

their
worker
even
cleaned
3
of
my
windows
and
changed
a
lightbulb
for
me
.

in
this
day
and
age
,
it
is
so
rare
to
find
a
company
with
such
nice
workers
and
such
far
ranging
guarantee
policies
.

i
rarely
write
reviews
such
as
this
one
,
but
they
certainly
deserve
anyone
's
business
!

friendly
staff
,
but
definitely
some
problems

may
,
2009
.

we
were
booked
at
the
sheraton
with
a
number
of
other
out
-
of
-
town
wedding
guests
.

got
put
into
the
wrong
room
the
first
night
,
and
were
quite
surprised
to
have
someone
with
the
same
room
key
trying
to
get
in
the
door
at
1:00
am
!

next
day
got
moved
into
another
room
,
on
the
same
floor
with
other
wedding
guests
.

there
were
3
adults
in
our
room
but
towels
for
only
2
,
no
linens
for
sofa
bed
.

in
the
second
room
it
took
3
tries
to
get
all
the
towels
and
linens
we
requested
.

a
package
and
some
wedding
cards
were
left
in
our
first
room
.

they
were
sent
to
our
second
room
and
had
been
opened
--
the
ribbon
-
wrapped
present
,
and
all
3
envelopes
.

security
in
the
hotel
seemed
to
be
excellent
,
but
we
were
never
given
an
explanation
as
to
why
someone
would
open
these
items
.

a
mid-afternoon
"
fire
drill
"
was
disruptive
,
putting
everyone
out
of
the
hotel
.

when
we
called
the
front
desk
about
an
extremely
boisterous
crowd
in
the
hall
outside
our
door
quite
late
at
night
,
it
seemed
to
take
the
hotel
staff
quite
a
while
to
quiet
them
down
.

the
staff
was
friendly
,
especially
the
front
desk
female
supervisor
,
and
seemed
to
want
to
help
,
but
too
many
unusual
things
happened
to
make
us
want
to
stay
there
again
.

be
careful
of
who
your
sales
guy
is

i
think
this
place
is
probably
really
great
especially
judging
by
the
reviews
on
here
.

my
experience
was
awful
though
.

it
all
had
to
do
with
the
sales
guy
which
was
a
young
22
year
old
who
had
admittedly
only
been
working
for
2
weeks
.

i
was
extremely
interested
in
the
car
and
very
likely
would
have
bought
it
,
but
the
sales
guy
i
dealt
with
ruined
the
deal
.

essentially
,
i
told
him
i
did
n't
trust
him
cause
he
was
a
car
salesman
,
but
he
got
so
incredibly
offended
at
that
statement
that
he
had
to
go
cry
to
another
salesman
and
compose
himself
before
coming
back
.

i
do
n't
know
if
the
kid
had
a
bad
day
or
what
,
but
i
had
to
sit
and
apologize
about
nothing
for
10
minutes
until
he
dropped
the
issue
.

after
that
,
i
just
tried
to
ignore
his
lack
of
professionalism
and
test
drive
the
car
.

i
played
dumb
and
asked
him
questions
that
i
already
knew
the
answers
to
and
he
responded
with
half
truths
and
a
few
falsehoods
.

for
instance
i
asked
who
owned
mazda
and
he
said
with
confidence
that
was
gm
,
which
is
n't
true
.

i
mean
,
i
do
n't
care
if
he
does
n't
know
,
but
if
he
pretends
to
know
and
tells
me
bs
to
my
face
,
there
's
no
way
i
'm
going
to
trust
him
when
matters
turn
to
the
price
of
the
car
and
financing
.

the
worst
chinese
i
've
ever
had

this
is
by
far
the
worst
chinese
food
i
have
ever
had
.

the
service
stunk
.

i
called
in
my
order
and
upon
arriving
to
pick
it
up
,
they
got
my
order
confused
with
someone
else
s
.

they
helped
about
three
other
people
before
they
offered
to
help
me
again
.

they
also
got
my
friend
s
order
mixed
up
and
wanted
to
charger
her
$
10
more
than
what
she
had
wanted
.

she
asked
for
the
dinner
combo
and
they
gave
her
two
dinner
plates
instead
.

we
were
standing
in
the
store
for
20
minutes
to
simply
pick
up
an
order
.

not
to
mention
that
the
wait
staff
was
about
as
pleasant
as
dealing
with
an
angry
bull
.

they
were
abrasive
and
rude
-
when
they
were
the
ones
who
messed
everything
up
.

we
had
to
throw
out
about
80
percent
of
our
meals
because
the
food
tasted
so
horrible
.

i
do
nt
know
how
it
is
possible
to
make
orange
chicken
,
sesame
chicken
and
kung
pao
chicken
as
well
as
cheese
puffs
taste
that
bad
but
china
delight
accomplished
that
.

the
only
thing
that
was
edible
was
the
steamed
rice
and
the
vegetable
lo
mein
was
barely
tolerable
.

i
will
never
go
here
again
.

lucky
panda
in
willis
is
a
billion
times
better
in
service
and
quality
of
the
meal
.

i
have
no
idea
how
china
delight
won
number
1
chinese
restaurant
in
montgomery
-
there
needs
to
be
a
recount
on
that
vote
.

terrible
service

one
of
the
worst
experiences
i
've
ever
had
with
a
auto
repair
shop
.

we
took
our
vehicle
in
for
a
repair
to
the
air
conditioning
.

approx
4
months
later
,
the
compressor
went
out
.

we
took
it
back
in
to
have
it
repaired
again
,
and
less
than
a
week
later
the
second
compressor
went
out
.

we
went
in
for
a
third
visit
and
they
fixed
it
again
,
but
this
time
when
we
picked
up
the
car
,
the
radio
and
clock
did
not
work
.

so
for
the
4th
time
in
5
months
and
the
third
time
in
2
weeks
,
we
brought
the
car
back
again
.

when
we
expressed
our
discontent
to
the
manager
(
that
's
right
,
the
manager
)
,
did
he
say
he
would
return
some
money
,
did
he
say
he
would
give
a
discount
on
our
next
visit
,
did
he
just
say
"
i
'm
sorry
"
.

nope
,
none
of
the
above
.

he
stood
there
and
told
us
how
he
was
n't
at
fault
.

it
was
the
fault
of
the
parts
supplier
,
and
can
we
imagine
how
he
felt
having
to
put
another
2
hours
of
work
in
the
car
.

and
what
did
we
expect
...
that
he
bench
test
every
part
.

at
no
time
during
the
conversation
did
the
words
,
"
i
'm
sorry
"
ever
come
out
of
his
mouth
.

i
,
nor
anyone
else
in
my
family
,
will
ever
go
to
sun
devil
auto
again
.

well
,
unless
of
course
the
third
compressor
he
put
in
the
car
goes
out
.

do
not
use
this
company
!

i
dropped
off
a
sheet
metal
piece
that
i
needed
copied
due
to
th
it
was
needing
to
be
replaced
.

i
asked
if
they
could
copy
the
piece
i
dropped
off
.

they
said
it
would
be
made
exactly
like
the
one
i
needed
to
replace
.

i
picked
it
up
when
it
was
finished
and
was
charge
30.00
.

when
i
got
to
the
job
and
tried
to
insert
the
new
piece
of
metal
it
would
not
fit
!!

i
took
the
original
piece
of
metal
and
rigged
it
to
make
due
since
i
had
to
complete
the
job
.

i
took
the
receipt
and
the
metal
that
did
not
fit
and
asked
pomper
for
my
money
back
.

the
girl
at
the
desk
was
sooo
rude
i
could
not
believe
it
!

she
told
me
she
could
not
use
the
piece
i
was
returning
and
the
company
would
only
put
it
in
the
trash
so
i
could
not
return
it
.

i
explained
i
did
not
get
what
i
paid
for
.

she
asked
me
to
bring
the
original
piece
back
and
i
told
her
i
had
to
use
it
on
the
job
.

she
told
me
that
was
to
bad
she
would
do
nothing
to
help
me
since
she
could
not
use
or
resell
the
piece
.

i
said
i
was
going
to
trash
it
also
and
could
i
at
least
have
a
credit
.

with
a
smirk
on
her
face
she
told
me
no
money
is
being
returned
and
that
is
the
way
it
was
.

do
not
use
this
company
.

there
are
to
many
people
that
need
our
business
to
have
to
put
up
with
this
unfair
treatment
!!!!!

i
would
never
recommend
this
gym
to
anyone
and
unfortunately
this
is
based
solely
on
the
owner
's
own
unprofessionalism
.

when
i
originally
joined
in
january
i
only
did
so
because
i
was
told
i
would
be
able
to
cancel
the
12
month
membership
if
i
was
to
move
away
.

i
signed
up
with
one
of
the
staff
who
was
very
pleasant
and
professional
.

actually
working
out
there
was
good
-
the
machines
are
nice
and
the
classes
are
fun
.

the
locker
room
is
certainly
lacking
-
i
would
never
shower
or
change
there
.

they
need
to
update
the
locker
rooms
asap
.

back
to
my
poor
rating
-
i
was
excepted
to
medical
school
and
went
in
to
cancel
my
membership
as
i
was
told
i
could
do
since
i
was
moving
away
.

the
owner
was
very
rude
,
accused
me
of
not
reading
my
contract
,
and
basically
told
me
to
shut
up
when
i
was
trying
to
ask
questions
to
further
understand
the
process
of
canceling
my
membership
.

i
was
able
to
cancel
it
but
only
after
paying
a
$
50
fee
(
which
the
staff
person
who
signed
me
up
stated
i
would
not
have
to
pay
if
i
had
proof
of
moving
)
and
being
spoken
to
in
a
very
belittling
manner
.

i
would
understand
if
i
was
being
treated
this
way
by
a
staff
member
but
the
club
's
actual
owner
?!

bad
for
business
.

i
was
appalled
.

i
will
never
recommend
this
gym
to
any
woman
.

the
equipment
and
classes
are
n't
good
enough
to
deal
with
the
rudeness
from
the
staff
!!!

there
are
better
places
on
the
cape

the
salon
experience
from
hell

i
feel
obligated
to
share
this
story
.

right
out
of
college
i
called
the
salon
and
explained
my
situation
.

just
graduated
,
just
moved
,
not
rich
,
and
starting
new
job
soon
.

i
never
got
a
price
quote
over
the
phone
and
they
take
your
cc
info
just
to
make
the
appointment
because
if
you
do
n't
show
up
,
they
'll
charge
you
.

i
had
this
ridiculous
celebrity
stylist
from
la
named
derrick
.

after
he
already
put
product
on
my
hair
he
said
"
i
should
warn
you
,
i
'm
expensive
.
"

what
was
i
supposed
to
do
,
say
i
ca
n't
afford
you
and
walk
out
with
crap
all
over
my
hair
.

i
wanted
to
be
very
blonde
and
instead
he
pulled
my
root
color
throughout
my
whole
hair
which
is
a
gross
mousey
brown
.

the
other
stylists
around
me
kept
pressuring
me
saying
he
's
so
wonderful
,
you
're
going
to
love
your
hair
.

$
400
later
my
jaw
dropped
when
the
receptionist
told
me
the
total
.

derrick
did
a
terrible
job
,
was
a
complete
jerk
the
entire
time
,
and
i
had
no
warning
as
to
the
price
.

i
cried
the
entire
way
home
.

he
then
"
fixed
"
it
for
free
but
it
still
looked
like
crap
.

i
will
never
go
back
.

it
was
the
salon
experience
from
absolutely
hell
.

he
also
told
me
that
he
worked
on
the
cast
of
will
and
grace
and
that
they
were
all
jerks
.

that
's
my
favorite
show
of
all
time
.

i
'm
pretty
sure
for
the
cast
that
it
was
the
other
way
around
.

maybe
he
did
n't
do
a
good
job
and
they
told
him
so
.

absolute
nightmare
!

stay
away
!

very
unhappy
...

working
with
rod
jacobsen
was
my
first
experience
working
with
a
cpa
,
so
i
did
not
know
what
to
expect
.

that
said
-
he
seemed
to
be
doing
well
enough
.

however
,
then
i
asked
to
amend
my
return
to
apply
a
credit
i
had
just
become
eligible
for
.

i
expected
to
pay
for
this
service
,
but
imagine
my
surprise
when
i
received
a
bill
for
more
than
what
i
paid
to
have
the
original
return
prepared
.

asked
why
,
rod
simply
told
me
that
he
had
to
research
how
to
do
the
amendment
(
it
was
an
amended
to
show
that
i
had
purchased
a
home
-
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
,
one
would
think
)
and
that
took
time
to
figure
out
.

well
,
that
was
strike
one
.

i
was
n't
going
to
use
them
again
,
but
i
was
going
to
leave
it
at
that
.

however
,
now
that
i
have
come
to
realize
that
i
am
going
to
owe
the
irs
$
6,000
+
despite
doing
exactly
what
rod
told
me
to
do
,
i
feel
i
have
to
voice
my
opinion
.

last
year
,
after
all
was
said
and
done
,
i
asked
rod
whether
my
payment
structure
would
leave
me
with
no
/
little
tax
liability
at
the
end
of
the
year
.

he
said
yes
.

well
,
again
,
i
am
now
faced
with
a
tax
bill
of
$
6,000
+
,
all
due
on
april
15
,
2010
and
all
that
rod
has
to
say
to
the
matter
is
'
well
,
you
wo
n't
have
to
pay
a
penalty
.
'

i
may
not
have
to
pay
a
penalty
,
yet
,
but
this
is
not
what
i
had
in
mind
when
hired
these
guys
.

in
the
words
of
my
new
accountant
,
they
let
me
down
!

bit
sketchy
,
sporadic
delivery
times

i
bought
about
half
of
the
furniture
i
own
from
this
place
.

why
?

because
they
cut
me
good
deals
if
i
paid
in
cash
.

sketchy
,
right
?

well
they
came
through
and
delivered
almost
all
of
my
items
within
a
few
days
.

(
they
even
got
me
a
couch
pretty
quickly
.
)

the
guy
who
was
cutting
me
the
deals
and
getting
me
the
furniture
quickly
,
ahmed
,
was
nice
and
mostly
professional
,
except
the
semi-sketchiness
.

then
one
day
,
ahmed
left
the
country
,
not
to
return
for
months
,
without
informing
me
.

he
also
neglected
to
tell
the
other
person
working
at
the
store
about
a
dining
room
table
that
i
had
ordered
and
that
was
supposed
to
be
coming
in
.

the
other
person
working
at
the
store
did
n't
know
that
i
still
had
this
table
coming
.

i
had
paid
in
cash
,
and
he
said
he
had
no
receipt
/
record
of
my
purchase
.

i
came
back
with
the
receipt
ahmed
had
provided
upon
my
purchase
,
and
the
guy
took
forever
to
copy
it
but
said
that
he
would
take
care
of
the
situation
.

i
waited
.

and
waited
.

he
never
once
contacted
us
.

i
've
had
to
pester
this
new
guy
several
times
to
ask
when
my
table
will
arrive
.

he
kept
saying
different
arrival
/
delivery
dates
and
did
n't
seem
terribly
apologetic
.

it
has
been
3
weeks
and
i
still
do
n't
have
my
table
(
which
was
not
cheap
,
i
might
add
)
.

point
is
:
you
might
be
able
to
get
a
good
deal
on
some
nice
furniture
--
which
i
did
--
but
they
're
not
very
communicative
and
god
forbid
something
goes
wrong
,
you
'll
have
to
fight
to
get
it
resolved
.

poor
service

run
do
n't
walk
.

my
experience
with
home
delivery
service
has
been
one
of
disappointment
and
anger
.

if
i
could
give
them
a
lower
rating
than
poor
i
would
.

on
august
21st
,
2009
i
ordered
furniture
from
hickory
furniture
mart
and
contracted
for
hds
to
deliver
it
.

after
seventeen
days
the
delivery
van
showed
up
at
my
home
minus
two
pieces
.

i
was
later
told
they
had
been
left
at
the
warehouse
and
some
future
date
they
would
be
delivered
.

no
one
will
give
me
a
date
.

i
spent
$
2300
on
the
bedroom
suite
,
which
was
complete
and
excellent
condition
on
the
showroom
floor
.

upon
delivery
it
was
clear
the
entire
set
was
damaged
:
a
piece
of
wood
was
broke
on
the
headboard
;
the
chest
of
drawers
was
missing
all
four
pieces
necessary
to
attach
the
legs
;
the
dresser
back
legs
were
pushed
in
causing
the
dresser
to
lean
into
the
wall
;
and
a
nighstand
was
missing
a
drawer
.

how
do
you
lose
a
drawer
.

after
complaining
on
september
10th
to
national
home
furnishings
,
boyles
,
the
hickory
furniture
mart
and
home
delivery
service
the
latter
finally
called
me
back
and
said
they
would
be
up
to
pick
the
dresser
and
chest
of
drawers
at
some
future
point
and
at
some
later
point
it
would
be
professional
repaired
and
at
some
later
point
it
would
be
returned
.

the
customer
service
at
home
delivery
service
was
terrible
let
alone
their
promise
to
proper
set
up
furniture
.

so
i
am
in
limbo
regarding
a
bedroom
suite
.

i
hope
the
owners
and
employees
of
this
store
have
broken
bedroom
suites
in
their
homes
and
furniture
sitting
in
someone
's
warehouse
.

maybe
then
they
will
begin
to
understand
poor
customer
service
and
terrible
sit
up
service
.

excellent
driving
school

i
was
involved
in
a
car
accident
20
years
ago
and
since
then
i
've
been
a
nervous
wreck
and
have
n't
been
behind
the
wheel
.

unfortunately
,
a
family
emergency
required
me
to
conquer
this
fear
.

a
very
good
friend
of
mine
highly
recommended
the
professional
driving
school
and
i
was
told
to
specifically
ask
for
gerry
.

she
highly
recommended
him
and
described
him
as
the
"
saintly
instructor
and
simply
the
best
instructor
there
is
....
very
calm
,
pleasant
and
very
detailed
in
giving
instructions
"
.

i
called
the
school
most
probably
10
times
before
i
finally
enrolled
in
a
20
hour
package
.

i
had
to
cancel
my
initial
lesson
4
times
and
on
the
5th
attempt
the
management
was
quick
enough
to
associate
my
cancellations
with
my
fear
and
finally
encouraged
me
into
taking
my
initial
lesson
.

five
minutes
before
my
initial
lesson
,
i
got
a
call
from
gerry
advising
me
of
his
arrival
and
to
come
down
as
soon
as
i
was
ready
.

my
heart
pounded
as
i
walked
down
and
pounded
even
faster
upon
seeing
gerry
in
an
suv
-
lexus
!

i
thought
of
canceling
the
lesson
once
again
because
i
did
n't
feel
comfortable
driving
an
suv
.

gerry
pleasantly
said
"
since
i
am
already
here
why
do
n't
we
give
it
shot
.

i
trust
you
and
believe
that
you
'll
be
able
to
handle
this
and
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
reciprocate
!

trust
me
and
most
especially
trust
and
believe
in
yourself
.

do
n't
worry
,
i
'll
take
care
of
you
!
"

.......
the
rest
was
history
!

here
i
am
now
driving
confidently
on
my
own
.

gerry
,
i
ca
n't
thank
you
enough
for
helping
me
cope
with
my
fear
.

to
my
friend
,
thank
you
for
your
recommendation
...
you
were
true
to
your
words
in
saying
gerry
is
a
"
saintly
instructor
...
absolutely
simple
the
best
instructor
and
best
driving
school
there
is
!

review
on
house
of
joy
chinese
restaurant

my
family
and
i
moved
to
san
antonio
a
year
ago
and
have
tried
almost
all
of
the
chinese
restaurants
because
we
love
chinese
food
.

well
it
took
us
a
while
to
find
one
that
we
liked
.

but
we
do
n't
just
like
house
of
joy
we
love
it
.

everything
we
have
gotten
there
has
been
more
authentic
and
better
tasting
than
any
other
chinese
restaurant
in
the
san
antonio
area
we
have
been
to
--
and
trust
me
we
have
been
to
a
lot
of
them
.

we
just
happen
to
stumble
across
this
little
restaurant
one
day
when
we
had
to
visit
the
bexar
county
tax
office
off
of
bandera
road
.

we
stopped
in
and
got
some
take
out
and
can
not
stop
going
back
.

they
have
the
best
egg
drop
soup
i
have
ever
tasted
.

we
also
love
their
egg
rolls
and
spring
rolls
.

and
every
entree
we
have
ordered
is
perfect
.

everything
is
always
cooked
fresh
and
tastes
fresh
.

their
prices
are
extremely
reasonable
for
the
amount
of
food
you
receive
.

the
staff
is
also
just
so
pleasant
to
deal
with
.

they
are
also
quick
at
getting
your
order
out
to
you
.

you
do
n't
have
to
sit
and
wait
around
forever
like
most
places
!!

so
anyone
looking
for
an
excellent
night
out
for
chinese
or
maybe
just
lunch
should
stop
in
and
try
it
because
i
promise
you
2
things
---
you
wo
n't
regret
it
!!

and
you
will
go
back
for
more
!!!

ps
i
have
noticed
on
here
that
someone
left
a
comment
that
"
all
of
the
nice
comments
must
come
from
co
workers
or
friends
"
and
i
will
tell
you
that
i
do
n't
know
these
people
except
from
eating
at
their
restaurant
.

we
are
from
virginia
and
just
moved
here
a
year
ago
.

so
that
comment
is
completely
false
.

because
we
think
it
's
the
best
!!!

and
we
do
n't
know
them
except
for
eating
there
.

dr.
strzalka
at
flagship
cvts
is
not
a
good
doctor

i
am
not
sure
about
the
quality
of
the
other
doctors
there
,
but
i
do
know
from
personal
experience
that
dr.
christopher
t.
strzalka
is
not
a
man
of
his
word
,
and
is
also
very
cruel
and
uncaring
!!

he
was
going
to
operate
and
replace
my
bicuspid
aortic
valve
due
to
critical
aortic
stenosis
.

i
had
a
surgery
date
of
july
17
,
2008
.

then
he
renigged
when
he
read
my
health
care
proxy
,
even
though
i
agreed
to
be
on
the
ventilator
for
2
months
following
surgery
(
as
he
had
twice
stated
i
must
agree
to
)
.

he
later
said
that
by
2
months
he
"
meant
at
least
two
months
"
.

two
months
and
at
least
two
months
are
totally
different
things
.

he
did
not
even
give
me
the
chance
to
say
i
would
stay
on
the
ventilator
longer
,
which
i
would
have
.

a
health
care
proxy
is
not
written
in
stone
and
can
be
changed
.

he
also
never
even
said
he
was
sorry
.

just
said
i
was
inoperable
and
walked
out
of
the
hospital
room
.

so
,
therefore
,
now
he
says
i
am
inoperable
(
even
though
i
am
not
100
%
inoperable
)
,
and
he
is
letting
me
die
.

i
am
just
middle
aged
and
do
not
want
to
die
,
but
thanks
to
this
doctor
i
have
no
other
alternatives
.

i
,
along
with
my
friends
,
consider
this
doctor
to
be
the
cause
of
my
death
as
he
is
not
even
trying
to
save
my
life
by
operating
.

even
my
pa
i
went
to
the
other
day
said
"
it
must
by
comforting
to
have
gone
to
a
heart
surgeon
like
him
who
will
do
nothing
for
you
"
.

he
said
it
sarcastically
.

if
you
want
a
doctor
who
will
lie
to
you
and
say
he
will
operate
and
then
change
his
mind
,
and
not
know
what
he
is
talking
about
when
he
recommends
procedures
at
other
hospitals
and
says
they
are
what
you
need
,
when
they
will
not
work
for
you
,
go
to
this
doctor
...
he
is
the
one
for
you
.

what
you
can
learn
from
the
below
'
bad
experience
'
.

i
would
suggest
not
avoiding
second
home
based
on
the
'
bad
experience
'
review
.

i
'd
probably
be
more
inclined
to
board
my
two
dogs
here
,
seeing
that
they
do
n't
just
take
every
dog
coming
in
.

i
've
toured
this
place
and
was
impressed
by
how
clean
the
place
was
,
and
all
the
options
for
the
dogs
.

it
's
unfortunate
that
bmil
believed
that
his
'
perfect
'
dog
was
not
given
the
right
opportunity
to
prove
himself
.

but
i
've
done
hundreds
of
dog
introductions
myself
(
another
place
,
i
do
n't
work
here
)
,
and
owners
can
have
unrealistic
expectations
and
views
of
what
they
see
when
their
dogs
meet
other
dogs
.

workers
who
do
these
introductions
look
at
the
interaction
objectively
;
and
it
's
good
to
see
they
are
able
and
willing
to
say
no
if
they
feel
there
would
be
a
problem
.

it
sounds
(
according
to
your
own
statement
)
that
they
had
a
roomful
of
dogs
,
so
they
must
be
doing
something
right
-
and
are
keeping
those
dogs
safe
from
potential
problems
.

you
say
you
work
a
lot
,
and
that
you
have
a
young
dog
;
so
i
have
little
doubt
that
your
dog
is
just
filled
with
energy
to
burn
;
and
it
is
good
of
you
to
look
for
a
place
to
take
him
.

but
not
at
a
risk
to
other
people
's
pets
.

you
were
clearly
given
another
alternative
by
second
home
,
to
board
him
-
which
might
have
given
your
dog
a
chance
to
come
and
go
from
second
home
a
couple
times
,
getting
used
to
the
place
and
maybe
facilitating
another
attempt
to
get
into
daycare
later
.

no
business
is
going
to
push
customers
away
without
good
reason
;
so
is
n't
it
reasonable
to
think
they
might
know
what
they
're
doing
?

my
dogs
are
far
from
perfect
,
and
one
of
them
i
believe
would
be
a
little
much
for
daycare
here
herself
(
at
least
initially
)
.

be
a
little
more
reasonable
with
your
expectations
of
a
place
like
this
;
and
maybe
do
n't
jump
to
personal
attacks
suggesting
that
they
do
n't
want
to
work
hard
,
just
because
you
bruised
your
own
ego
.

dumbest
f'ers
ever

i
called
dominos
tonight
,
it
rang
forever
,
i
get
put
on
hold

says

says

yes

i
say
,

street
and
i
am
3
blocks
west
of

and
one
south
of

.

hmmm
,
she
says
,
then
why
are
you
calling
here
,
we
do
n't
go
past
broad
?

anyway
,
after
much
yelling
and
cussing
i
hung
up
,
grabbed
a
cab
,
and
went
to
geno
's
.

quick
to
take
money
but
not
quick
to
fix
a
problem
!

b&b
came
out
very
quickly
to
give
us
our
quote
back
in
june
.

they
were
very
polite
,
eager
to
answer
any
questions
and
willing
to
wait
for
us
to
return
from
vacation
to
begin
installing
our
fence
.

our
fence
was
installed
quickly
in
august
and
they
had
their
money
and
left
saying
"
workmanship
is
guaranteed
for
a
year
!
"
.

within
a
week
we
noticed
one
of
the
boards
on
our
gate
splitting
where
a
nail
had
gone
in
.

we
called
our
representative
who
assured
me
he
would
call
the
office
and
have
it
taken
care
of
.

we
heard
nothing
.

we
then
called
the
office
and
the
man
we
spoke
to
said
he
'd
send
someone
out
to
look
at
it
but
could
n't
promise
when
-
two
weeks
came
and
went
and
we
heard
nothing
.

i
just
called
again
and
was
told
that
workmanship
,
not
wood
,
is
guaranteed
for
a
year
-
well
in
my
opinion
-
the
wood
split
due
to
a
nail
which
is
part
of
workmanship
!

she
even
went
so
far
as
to
say
"
you
r
calling
about
one
board
?
"

well
-
when
you
pay
over
$
1000
for
something
you
want
it
to
hold
up
and
look
good
!!!

yes
!

i
was
calling
about
one
board
!!

i
'm
very
frustrated
at
this
point
-
it
would
take
all
of
10
min
for
them
to
come
by
and
replace
the
one
board
that
is
cracked
(
the
crack
is
deep
enough
to
stick
a
penny
in
it
and
it
goes
clear
through
)
yet
they
do
not
want
to
take
the
time
to
bother
with
what
once
was
a
happy
customer
and
has
now
become
a
dissatisfied
customer
.

so
i
figure
if
they
do
n't
want
to
take
the
time
to
fix
the
fence
that
they
installed
then
i
'll
take
the
time
to
let
everyone
i
can
know
about
how
they
treat
customers
once
they
have
your
money
!!!

stay
away
!!!

you
get
what
you
pay
for
!!!

they
came
in
under
a
lot
of
other
quotes
and
now
i
know
why
!!!

when
the
fence
was
first
installed
i
would
have
given
them
five
stars
,
now
for
their
poor
customer
follow
-
up
and
unwillingness
to
fix
the
fence
they
have
dropped
to
a
one
-
star
in
my
opinion
!

lots
of
rules
,
phantom
innkeeper
,
last
minute
price
was
worth
it
.

i
called
the
"
207
"
number
and
listened
to
the
same
recording
loop
3
times
before
i
gave
up
.

i
then
called
the
800
number
(
which
was
answered
)
and
inquired
about
last
minute
rates
.

they
had
a
room
with
a
$
99
rate
,
which
i
booked
.

the
room
was
supposed
to
be
on
the
2nd
floor
,
but
they
put
us
on
the
3rd
.

the
email
confirmation
(
which
i
read
in
the
car
)
warned
about
large
suitcases
,
declaring
that
we
are
innkeepers
,
not
longshoreman
.

in
other
words
,
they
do
not
help
with
suitcases
,
but
they
promise
totes
to
help
.

however
upon
our
arrival
no
one
there
(
the
inn
was
open
)
.

so
no
totes
.

finally
a
chambermaid
stuck
her
head
around
the
corner
from
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
told
us
sternly
that
we
could
not
be
accommodated
until
3
m
,
no
exceptions
.

then
she
was
gone
.

we
returned
after
3
pm
,
found
no
one
there
,
and
a
note
from
the
innkeeper
with
directions
to
our
room
.

combo
that
did

no

do
n't

the
rooms
off

two
kitchens

they
are
right
off
the
kitchen
so
you
hear
everything

free
parking

i
'd
go
back
if
i
could
get
the
last
minute
rate
again
of
$
99
,
but
i
would
n't
pay
their
rack
rate
.

quit
with
the
overstatements
!

the
worst
thing
that
can
happen
for
any
restaurant
like
zahav
is
to
have
too
many
people
write
hyperbolic
reviews
making
claims
that
"
everyone
"
is
going
to
"
love
"
the
food
,
decor
and
service
.

the
truth
is
,
in
my
and
my
dining
partners
'
experience
,
this
is
a
fine
little
restaurant
with
some
unique
food
.

it
's
an
entirely
up
and
down
experience
,
however
.

now
,
the
best
of
that
unique
food
comes
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
meal
.

the
salatim
salads
are
the
smallest
plates
i
've
ever
seen
placed
in
front
of
me
(
you
would
most
likely
think
they
were
condiments
if
it
were
n't
explained
to
you
)
.

though
they
are
mostly
excellent
,
you
generally
do
n't
get
enough
forkfuls
to
know
if
you
really
love
them
.

that
being
said
,
the
laffa
and
hummus
are
out
of
this
world
.

then
again
,
for
the
three
of
us
who
dined
together
,
two
pieces
of
flatbread
left
us
fighting
for
more
,
and
licking
the
hummus
from
our
fingers
(
and
yes
,
those
two
pieces
of
flatbread
did
represent
a
three
-
person
order
)
.

dinner
was
also
an
up
-
and
-
down
experience
.

the
vegetarian
dishes
and
lighter
fare
were
almost
always
spot
-
on
,
while
the
lamb
was
often
dry
and
/
or
overcooked
.

the
duck
was
a
65
%
glob
of
chewy
fat
with
no
resemblance
to
the
juicy
,
crispy
delicacy
it
usually
represents
at
other
establishments
.

dessert
was
...
hmmm
,
that
's
interesting
,
i
do
n't
even
remember
dessert
.

i
guess
that
tells
you
a
lot
.

oh
,
yes
,
the
chocolate
semifreddo
was
quite
good
.

the
warm
chocolate
cake
was
very
tasty
,
but
served
at
room
temperature
,
not
warm
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
.

and
my
--
no
,
i
still
do
n't
remember
what
i
had
.

service
was
average
,
but
nothing
special
,
and
restaurants
that
are
supposed
to
be
excellent
should
do
a
better
job
of
training
their
waitstaff
to
be
communicative
and
friendly
,
not
merely
capable
.

perhaps
had
we
not
gone
into
this
restaurant
believing
zahav
was
going
to
be
golden
as
its
name
suggests
(
and
as
the
many
golden
reviews
seem
to
attest
)
,
we
would
have
enjoyed
a
decent
little
expensive
experience
.

but
one
should
not
go
here
expecting
something
fantastic
,
unless
perhaps
you
've
never
had
middle
-
eastern
food
before
,
or
succulent
duck
,
tasty
lamb
,
decent
portion
sizes
or
actually
warm
chocolate
desserts
.

ps
)
when
we
called
for
a
reservation
,
we
were
told
that
5:00
and
9:30
were
their
only
openings
.

when
we
arrived
at
5
,
and
left
circa
7
,
there
were
the
same
4
or
5
empty
tables
surrounding
us
.

did
they
think
we
were
going
to
feel
lucky
to
get
any
reservation
at
all
,
and
therefore
be
more
pleased
with
our
dining
experience
?

must
read
-
do
not
waste
your
time
in
this
store
.

at
my
appointment
the
girl
helping
me
was
unable
to
adequately
lace
up
some
of
the
dresses
.

they
felt
like
they
were
going
to
fall
off
of
me
and
it
was
very
difficult
to
see
what
i
would
actually
look
like
were
i
to
purchase
some
of
these
dresses
.

i
thought
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
see
how
a
few
that
i
liked
would
look
like
on
a
model
(
by
looking
the
dress
up
online
)
.

so
,
as
i
was
leaving
i
asked
for
the
designer
/
dress
name
or
style
number
associated
with
my
top
picks
.

they
said
they
were
"
unable
to
tell
me
until
they
ordered
my
dress
"
.

hmmm
...
a
person
can
not
call
a
company
,
if
you
have
no
idea
its
name
(
since
the
designer
is
unknown
...
supposedly
)
,
and
order
a
gown
without
a
dress
name
or
style
number
.

do
other
brides
fall
for
this
???

they
either
:
a
)
do
n't
want
to
give
it
to
me
because
they
do
n't
want
me
purchasing
the
dress
elsewhere
or
b
)
are
recreating
the
dresses
themselves
(
ie
stealing
other
designers
'
dress
designs
and
"
filling
the
orders
"
by
their
own
seamstresses
)
.

i
'm
no
detective
but
...
uhh
...
seriously
?!?

whatever
type
of
operation
they
are
running
,
i
'm
not
interested
and
if
you
're
smart
,
you
wo
n't
be
either
.

what
a
waste
of
time
.

aside
from
that
little
*
mystery
*
,
one
of
the
sales
ladies
was
quite
comfortable
telling
me
how
wrong
i
was
about
how
another
dress
that
i
loved
compared
to
one
of
her
dresses
that
i
was
trying
on
.

somehow
,
since
she
supposedly
does
n't
know
any
names
of
designers
/
dresses
,
after
i
told
her
the
designer
and
dress
name
of
the
one
i
was
comparing
,
she
knew
"
exactly
which
dress
"
i
was
referring
to
and
disagreed
with
my
observation
;
she
said
that
the
bodice
did
come
as
low
as
the
one
i
had
on
.

my
point
:
even
if
i
was
wrong
,
do
n't
sit
there
and
argue
with
the
customer
.

say
something
like
,
"
huh
.

i
did
n't
think
so
but
you
could
be
right
.
"

unless
you
want
to
take
the
"
tell
the
customer
how
wrong
she
is
and
try
and
force
her
into
a
dress
she
's
obviously
not
loving
"
approach
which
will
likely
get
you
...
uh
...
nowhere
.

seriously
:
do
not
waste
your
time
.

other
shops
around
this
city
have
much
nicer
and
more
transparent
owners
.

not
owners
that
seem
like
they
have
something
to
hide
and
know
nothing
about
common
courtesy
and
customer
service
.

i
felt
very
much
like
wedding
gallery
was
being
dishonest
and
i
would
n't
trust
them
to
lace
me
up
in
another
gown
let
alone
trust
them
with
the
gown
i
will
wear
on
the
most
important
day
of
my
life
.

awful
service
!

after
happily
visiting
sear's
automotives
in
the
past
,
i
was
shocked
at
the
horrible
service
received
at
their
greensboro
location
.

i
brought
my
car
in
on
a
sunday
to
replace
a
shredded
tire
.

i
waited
about
20
minutes
in
the
store
part
before
anyone
was
able
to
assist
me
and
was
then
told
to
pull
my
car
into
the
shop
(
that
is
apparently
what
you
are
supposed
to
do
,
but
the
big
signs
pointing
you
that
way
are
for
some
reason
kept
inside
the
garage
,
so
you
do
n't
see
them
drving
up
,
and
they
purposely
block
the
front
pull
-
up
that
all
other
sear's
use
)
.

once
inside
,
i
had
to
stand
around
for
at
least
10
more
minutes
before
--
finally
--
a
technician
got
to
me
.

once
i
returned
to
pick
up
my
car
,
you
can
believe
i
spent
quite
a
bit
more
time
standing
around
waiting
.

i
had
wanted
to
split
the
total
between
a
credit
card
and
check
card
since
i
was
being
reimbursed
for
the
tire
but
was
told
this
was
n't
possible
.

once
i
actually
got
back
in
my
car
,
it
was
dirty
and
had
grease
all
over
the
steering
wheel
.

ok
,
one
bad
experience
...
fine
.

the
following
friday
,
i
returned
with
my
car
to
go
ahead
and
replace
the
other
3
tires
,
which
were
worn
.

i
would
not
have
gone
back
,
but
i
could
n't
find
the
particular
tire
they
'd
used
in
stock
anywhere
else
.

once
again
,
i
waited
for
quite
a
bit
before
being
attended
to
.

i
got
the
order
completed
,
and
then
questioned
the
technician
since
it
came
out
about
$
40
less
than
i
expected
.

he
said
it
was
the
same
tire
,
and
verified
this
,
after
checking
both
the
actual
tire
on
my
car
and
my
service
papers
from
earlier
in
the
week
.

however
,
when
he
printed
out
the
service
quote
,
i
could
see
that
it
was
not
the
correct
tire
,
and
was
not
even
an
appropriate
tire
for
my
car
model
.

so
i
pointed
this
out
to
him
,
at
which
point
he
said
they
only
had
one
of
the
correct
tires
in
stock
.

ok
--
fine
.

so
i
got
just
my
other
rear
tire
replaced
.

they
promised
it
'd
be
done
within
an
hour
,
so
i
waited
in
the
lobby
.

over
two
hours
later
(
and
ten
minutes
before
they
closed
)
my
car
was
finally
finished
.

a
few
minutes
after
i
left
,
i
was
called
and
informed
that
"
i
"
left
my
wheel
lock
(
which
they
should
have
left
in
the
car
)
.

of
course
,
they
would
be
closing
in
5
minutes
,
so
i
would
have
to
hurry
up
or
get
it
the
next
day
.

of
course
i
could
n't
make
it
back
in
time
(
and
they
apparently
could
not
stay
5
extra
minutes
to
wait
for
me
)
.

the
next
day
,
no
one
could
find
my
wheel
lock
and
that
particular
technician
was
not
in
.

of
course
,
they
could
n't
call
him
either
to
ask
about
it
because
apparently
they
do
n't
keep
their
employees
'
phone
numbers
(
riiight
)
,
so
i
would
have
to
return
on
monday
(
driving
for
3
days
now
with
no
wheel
lock
should
i
get
a
flat
)
.

on
monday
i
called
and
again
it
was
a
big
to
-
do
to
find
anyone
who
knew
anything
about
it
.

supposedly
they
will
be
holding
it
for
me
this
evening
,
but
i
'm
sure
that
will
also
be
a
huge
ordeal
.

the
employees
at
this
sear's
are
completely
apathetic
and
there
did
n't
seem
to
be
any
sort
of
management
that
i
could
see
.

i
will
never
return
there
again
(
and
now
have
some
serious
doubts
about
the
quality
of
work
they
actually
performed
on
my
car
)
.
the
dude
who
grills
the
retarded
dogs
is
rude
.

if
this
is
the
best
that
tucson
has
to
offer
,
i
am
out
ta
here
...

i
called
on
a
friday
at
12:30
complaining
of
a
severe
toothache
.

dr.
obina
told
me
that
his
office
closed
at
noon
and
that
i
should
call
him
on
monday
.

i
had
been
a
patient
of
dr.
olbina
for
9
years
and
had
spent
thousands
of
dollars
on
crowns
etc
.

there
are
plenty
of
good
dentists
in
fernandina
.

do
n't
go
to
amelia
gentle
dentistry
.

good
location

for
a
hotel
like
this
you
would
expect
some
form
of
free
internet
.

what
you
get
is
a
$
13
/
day
charge
to
access
the
internet
through
a
slow
512
/
512
kb
/
s
that
you
can
only
use
to
check
email
etc
(
read
:
no
downloading
)
.

other
than
that
the
hotel
is
in
a
good
location
and
the
breakfast
is
great

make
you
feel
like
a
number

stay
away
from
kids
first
west
chester
.

you
never
get
a
human
on
the
phone
.

it
's
impossible
to
get
an
appointment
.

if
you
get
caught
in
traffic
and
are
a
couple
minutes
late
they
make
you
re-schedule
...
for
6
weeks
later
.

and
worst
of
all
your
child
feels
like
a
number
not
a
patient
.

go
somewhere
else

first
time
eating
at
caffe
bella
italia
and
it
was
a
wonderful
experience
.

from
the
delectable
antipasto
misto
to
the
spaghetti
alla
barese
and
the
parmigiana
and
ending
with
gelato
,
all
was
mouth
watering
.

too
bad
they
were
out
of
the
chocolate
lava
cake
.

maybe
next
time
they
will
have
it
.

service
was
excellent
!

at
the
time
of
booking
my
car
a
lot
was
promised
but
delivered
not
even
one
tenth
of
what
was
promised
.

apart
from
that
in
spite
of
my
repeated
attempts
i
could
not
get
in
touch
with
the
manager
to
even
lodge
an
official
complaint

my
advise
to
all
is
i
have
fallen
into
this
trap
...
pl
ensure
you
do

course
has
come
a
long

at
first
,
but
the
new
grounds
superintendant
has
done
wonders
for
the
course
!!

the
comment
below
definitely
needs
to
be
retracted
!

come
back
and
give
hcc
a
second
chance
at
least
!

it
is
a
great
course
for
local
golfers
to
be
proud
of
and
all
the
comments
in
2008
have
been
very
positive
!!

excellent
physiotherapists
!

kusal
goonewardena
and
his
team
of
physios
are
unbelievable
!

i
have
been
suffering
from
back
pain
for
over
12
years
and
have
been
to
numerous
specialists
,
physios
,
osteos
and
chiros
with
no
help
.

it
took
the
vigor
team
only
4
visits
to
get
me
feeling
normal
!

and
now
2
months
after
my
last
appointment
i
am
better
than
ever
.

thanks
guys
!

they
must
have
read
these
reviews
and
improved
!

my
husband
and
i
happened
in
on
a
whim
.

we
sat
in
the
front
dining
area
,
it
was
very
cozy
and
pleasant
.

our
server
was
quite
attentive
and
the
food
was
fantastic
.

my
husband
has
been
a
professional
chef
,
so
he
is
a
good
judge
of
quality
food
.

this
was
a
flavorful
,
enjoyable
meal
for
both
of
us
.

rude
rude
rude

went
in
there
and
got
my
dog
groomed
came
home
to
an
uneven
dog
then
took
him
back
to
get
evened
up
what
a
mistake
!

she
did
nt
even
let
me
finish
a
sentence
without
insulting
me
and
telling
me
how
i
should
have
said
it
!

i
wo
nt
go
back
!

she
needs
to
develop
a
personality
!

brought
dog
home
and
it
s
all
choppy
now
!

it
's
helpful
to
know
a
quite
a
bit
about
bull
fighting
.

if
you
watch
a
lot
of
fights
(
youtube
)
and
research
some
of
the
history
(
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bullfighting
)
you
will
find
yourself
enjoying
it
a
lot
more
!

also
after
seeing
a
handful
of
bullfights
,
i
can
say
that
they
're
a
lot
more
enjoyable
if
you
're
smashed
(
bac
>=
.15
)
.

all
i
can
say
is
that
i
am
glad
i
went
in
!

the
nurses
are
sweet
as
pie
and
the
doctor
is
wonderful
.

this
place
is
about
healing
,
not
making
a
buck
.

the
followup
visit
is
free
!!

after
going
to
the
hospital
and
paying
er
prices
...
there
is
no
way
i
wo
n't
be
back
here
!!

i
will
be
back
and
telling
everyone
about
this
clinic
.

thank
you
!!

i
just
like
the
fact
that
he
was
able
to
do
the
specific
type
of
repair
i
wanted
(
a
reball
)
and
give
me
the
longest
warranty
and
even
a
lower
price
.

someone
else
i
found
that
said
they
could
do
it
but
wanted
to
charge
me
more
and
give
me
less
warranty
.

it
was
a
no
brainer
really
.

i
choose
console
pros
and
i
'm
happy
i
did
.

this
place
is
bad
.

it
's
dark
,
dingy
&
dirty
.

the
salads
are
limp
and
the
rest
of
the
food
is
n't
any
better
(
ok
,
the
nachos
are
not
too
bad
!
)

this
place
may
have
been
something
sometime
;
but
it
way
past
it
"
sell
by
date
"
.

i
have
eaten
here
twice
in
the
past
year
and
will
not
go
back
and
can
not
recommend
it
.

ham
s
on
friendly
...
rip

this
is
the
original
ham
's
restaurant
,
expanded
into
a
regional
chain
in
the
late
80's
--
but
this
one
is
no
more
.

victim
of
hard
times
and
i
suspect
failing
corporate
management
.

according
to
news
accounts
,
the
company
is
struggling
.

i
have
many
fond
memories
of
my
college
evenings
there
long
ago
.

so
long
ham
s
...
you
will
be
missed
.

we
are
very
pleased
with
the
services
of
first
glass
window
.

our
window
panes
were
so
dirty
that
they
needed
a
specialist
to
come
and
clean
them
.

we
called
few
companies
before
we
decide
to
hire
them
.

they
came
on
time
and
completed
their
work
quickly
.

we
were
very
happy
how
clean
looked
our
windows
.

if
you
have
some
problems
with
your
windows
,
you
should
call
them
.

great
help
even
near
closing
time
!

i
came
in
to
town
for
a
week
and
forgot
my
trainers
!

oh
no
!!

i
came
in
30
min
before
close
and
the
staff
was
super
helpful
.

they
spent
a
lot
of
time
with
me
and
got
me
into
a
great
pair
of
shoes
.

i
think
they
may
even
be
better
than
the
pair
i
have
been
using
this
past
year
!

thanks
run
on
!

great

this
is
a
perfect
place
to
get
your
hair
done
.

i
have
gone
there
time
and
time
again
whenever
i
need
to
get
my
hair
done
or
when
i
want
a
haircut
.

when
i
get
my
hair
done
there
,
they
use
enough
hairstyling
products
while
it
does
not
ruin
your
hair
.

the
service
is
great
and
during
weekends
it
tends
to
get
busy
,
but
the
wait
is
worthwhile
.

highly
recommend

i
have
worked
with
shannon
as
my
massage
therapist
and
intuitive
bodyworker
for
years
and
have
never
been
disappointed
.

no
matter
what
state
i
am
in
when
i
arrive
,
i
always
leave
feeling
better
.

she
has
not
only
helped
me
through
some
challenging
computer
-
work
and
sports
related
injuries
,
she
was
wonderful
to
work
with
throughout
my
pregnancy
and
beyond
.

i
highly
recommend
her
.

best
store
in
boothbay
harbor

what
a
fantastic
store
,
i
love
this
place
.

not
the
same
old
stuff
that
all
the
other
stores
have
.

their
items
are
very
unique
,
great
quality
,
great
prices
.

they
also
have
the
best
tea
i
ever
had
,
not
at
all
like
the
junk
you
get
at
the
grocery
stores
,
i
stock
up
when
ever
there
because
they
are
closed
in
the
winter
.

the
best

dr.
aster
and
her
team
have
been
a
strong
advocate
in
the
health
of
both
my
daughters
.

dr.
aster
is
very
kind
an
gentle
with
the
children
,
but
also
positive
and
to
the
point
with
the
parents
.

she
is
and
excellent
doctor
to
have
on
one
's
team
.

even
though
i
live
pretty
far
from
her
office
i
still
make
the
trip
so
my
daughters
will
have
the
best
!

my
wife
and
i
avoided
doing
some
fairly
simple
electrical
re-wiring
in
our
home
for
several
years
due
to
overall
hassle
and
cost
involved
.

i
finally
called
matt
from
bonafide
and
he
made
the
project
both
easy
for
us
and
reasonable
.

he
was
prompt
,
knowledgable
,
friendly
,
clean
and
just
an
overall
great
guy
who
obviously
cares
about
his
business
.

i
will
reccommend
his
services
however
/
whenever
possible
!

real
pros

i
've
had
writer
friends
describe
horror
stories
with
their
printers
.

i
tell
them
:
why
not
just
go
with
these
guys
?

richard
joule
and
the
gang
are
pros
from
start
to
finish
.

they
set
out
to
exceed
your
expectations
.

already
i
'm
considering
future
projects
,
and
i
can
assure
you
that
for
my
printing
needs
i
will
be
choosing
no
other
than
atlanta
paperback
book
printing
.

i
have
been
here
3
times
and
all
3
times
it
has
been
bad
!

they
have
messed
up
my
order
and
....
the
food
was
just
not
good
!

i
had
sonic
in
many
other
palces
but
for
some
reason
this
sonic
is
always
just
covered
in
grease
and
not
good
...
:(

i
hope
they
get
there
act
together
...

i
am
going
to
give
it
one
last
chance
in
next
few
months
and
see
??

i
called
them
for
an
estimate
and
they
insulted
me
when
i
ask
them
questions
.

they
are
very
rude
and
nasty
.

please
do
n't
use
this
moving
company
if
you
do
n't
want
to
:
cry
,
have
trouble
and
a
bad
experience
on
the
day
of
your
move
.

they
will
give
you
a
low
price
over
the
phone
and
on
the
day
of
your
move
they
will
change
the
price
,
i
guarantee
it
.

you
've
got
maids
did
a
fabulous
job
cleaning
my
home
.

i
am
hiring
them
to
come
once
a
week
now
that
they
got
my
house
to
where
they
can
maintain
it
for
only
an
hour
and
a
half
every
two
weeks
!

satisfactory
for
sure
with
the
sercvice
!

beats
having
one
"
cleaning
lady
"
who
took
twice
as
long
and
did
not
do
a
very
through
job
like
the
"
maids
"
did
!

this
place
has
the
best
baby
and
children
s
clothes
.

especially
high
end
keep
sake
sort
of
clothing
that
you
just
ca
nt
find
in
a
lot
of
stores
.

it
is
all
very
unique
and
you
wo
nt
find
any
other
baby
wearing
the
same
stuff
.

i
spent
quite
a
bit
because
i
spoil
my
little
princess
.

after
all
she
will
only
be
a
baby
for
so
long
i
figure
why
not
enjoy
it
.

antique

great
place
for
antique
lighting
!

i
visited
their
huge
chicago
lighting
showroom
and
all
i
have
to
say
is
wow
!!

lots
of
collections
,
many
antique
light
fixtures
,
chandeliers
,
custom
lighting
etc
.

i
think
they
have
the
largest
collection
for
chandeliers
chicago
.

antiques
,
vintage
,
contemporary
&
modern
chandeliers
.

i
would
recommend
them
for
any
custom
lighting
or
lighting
repair
and
restoration
chicago

great
food
awesome
food
awesome
service

i
wanted
to
try
someplace
new
again
.

this
place
rocked
.

brought
my
wife
deb
with
me
and
she
like
the
fried
crab
wontons
and
said
they
were
good
..

we
also
had
the
bbq
spare
ribs
..
good
also
.

i
ordered
the
moo
shu
pork
and
it
was
great
..

i
also
ordered
the
neptune
platter
which
was
awesome
...
so
this
place
gets
5
out
of
5
stars
.

do
not
go
here
!!!

i
went
to
get
my
nails
filled
friday
,
by
monday
2
were
broken
.

i
was
not
happy
with
the
way
they
looked
,
very
wavy
,
uneven
edges
,
and
with
the
exception
of
1
,
there
is
a
dip
in
the
center
of
each
nail
.

i
also
had
a
pedicure
,
and
they
cut
my
nails
too
short
,
one
of
my
big
toes
looks
like
it
s
getting
infected
.

no
way
.

i
'm
certainly
no
expert
on
asian
food
in
fact
not
even
a
lover
of
vietnamese
food
but
i
wanted
to
try
the
real
things
here
at
a
dong
.

cold
,
slimy
,
tasteless
however
is
the
same
in
all
languages
and
foods
.

not
good
,
not
great
,
and
again
another
disappointment
in
central
iowa
.

how
do
these
places
stay
in
business
.

this
town
needs
some
food
soul
and
this
is
not
it
.

worth
every
penny

my
girlfriend
and
i
ate
at
the
grill
last
night
,
and
our
experience
was
amazing
.

everything
we
ordered
was
prepared
to
perfection
,
and
was
presented
perfectly
.

the
asparagus
,
seared
tuna
,
and
lobster
tail
were
the
best
we
ever
had
.

then
the
desserts
came
,
and
they
were
hands
down
the
best
dessert
we
ever
had
.

i
will
sum
it
up
with
,
it
was
worth
every
penny
!

best
chinese
restaurant
ever
!!!

it
was
the
best
chinese
food
i
have
ever
had
.

all
the
food
tasted
excellent
,
and
with
the
new
renovation
of
chairs
and
the
bathroom
,
it
is
awesome
.

the
people
working
their
are
also
extremely
polite
and
friendly
.

every
time
i
go
,
kevin
,
the
manager
,
will
always
remember
my
family
and
i
.

overall
,
it
is
very
family
oriented
,
and
i
recommend
it
to
everyone
!!!

if

nigel
from
nidd
design
has
always
provided
a
first
class
service
,
from
his
advice
and
professionalism
to
the
quality
of
his
design

planning

he
really
does
turn
your
dreams
into
reality
for
your
home

we
came
at
around
730
and
they
close
at
8
and
wanted
to
try
the
specials
but
they
were
out
for
the
day
so
i
would
say
go
way
before
they
close
.

got
the
crab
rangoon
which
was
great
,
tofu
with
cabbage
which
was
spicy
but
good
and
shrimp
satay
which
was
also
good
.

def
going
to
come
back
and
try
this
place
again
.

bea
was
really
nice
and
asked
how
the
food
was
.

cute
place
also

as
a
native
southern
californian
i
can
tell
you
that
this
is
not
authentic
mexican
food
.

however
,
i
still
like
this
place
a
lot
.

esp.
the
mole
,
tortilla
soup
,
and
guacamole
.

margaritas
are
alright
.

my
only
complaint
is
the
queso
.

it
used
to
be
fabulous
,
why
did
you
guys
change
it
??

queso
should
not
be
watery
:(
.....

***
update
***
never
mind
!

they
fixed
the
queso
!

thank
you
thank
you

there
are
so
many
wonderful
great
places
to
dine
in
houston
....
do
n't
.
waste
your
time
here
.

i
had
the
morelias
enchiladas
.

the
sauce
was
dry
and
the
enchiladas
did
not
taste
good
.
at
all
.

in
fact
my
friend
vomited
after
our
meal
.

maybe
we
ordered
the
wrong
dish
but
my
experience
here
was
poor
.

service
was
okay
not
great
,
we
came
for
a
late
lunch
.

i
do
n't
recommend
this
place
.

skylight
repair

my
skylight
was
making
a
horrible
noise
when
the
wind
blew
.

james
bateman
came
the
day
i
called
and
fixed
the
problem
quickly
and
efficiently
.

he
also
inspected
my
entie
roof
to
see
if
there
was
anything
else
that
needed
attention
.

he
called
the
next
day
to
see
if
everything
was
to
my
satisfaction
.

when
the
next
hailstorm
blows
through
,
i

small
firm
with
great
service

bloom
legal
was
really
attentive
to
my
problem
,
and
seth
bloom
took
the
time
to
help
me
understand
the
legal
issue
i
was
dealing
with
.

i
much
preferred
the
one
-
on
-
one
service
here
to
the
experiences
i
've
had
with
bigger
offices
and
firms
.

while
i
hope
i
do
n't
have
any
need
for
a
lawyer
anytime
soon
,
if
i
do
i
'll
definitely
use
this
firm
again
.

used
their
service
for
the
first
time
and
was
immediately
impressed
by
their
professionalism
(
received
a
phone
call
soon
after
order
was
placed
to
confirm
details
)
and
the
subsequent
delivery
of
my
gift
(
to
split
,
croatia
)
was
as
requested
.

the
gift
itself
was
exactly
as
described
and
pictured
in
the
catalogue
and
of
the
highest
standard
.

would
highly
recommend
to
anyone
requiring
overseas
gift
delivery

i
love
my
gym
!

fitness
unlimited
is
a
second
home
to
a
lot
of
us
gym
members
who
work
out
daily
.

if
you
are
serious
about
working
out
in
a
non-commercial
like
atmosphere
then
you
have
chosen
the
best
place
to
be
.

this
is
the
most
humble
gym
you
will
every
step
into
....
if
you
dare
to
work
on
your
body
do
n't
be
surprised
when
you
see
how
addicting
going
to
fitness
unlimited
can
be
!!

over-rated
...

this
restaurant
is
over-rated
.

it
is
hard
to
find
...
and
the
mexican
food
is
bland
,
almost
equivalent
to
eating
out
of
a
can
.

the
service
is
poor
...

i
asked
for
a
fried
egg
on
my
enchiladas
...
and
did
not
get
it
.!

secondly
,
the
enchladas
did
not
come
with
enchilada
sauce
..
but
chili
...
like
hormel
's
chili
..
the
cheese
was
american
cheese
!

the
chili
relleno
..
had
no
batter
on
it
.

i
googled
restaurants
in
the
area
and
fuji
sushi
came
up
and
reviews
were
great
so
i
made
a
carry
out
order
of
:
l
17
.

mixed
tempura
.....................
8.25
shrimp
or
vegetable
tempura
&
salad
.

i
was
very
happy
with
the
customer
service
and
even
more
please
with
the
portion
size
,
to
go
box
set
up
and
quality
of
the
food
for
the
price
.

i
'm
very
happy
and
will
definitely
dine
in
and
carry
out
again
.

good
pizza
at
a
good
price

i
just
moved
nearby
and
have
tried
several
of
the
local
places
,
this
was
the
first
one
and
i
should
have
just
stuck
with
it
.

the
pizza
is
usually
pretty
good
,
the
only
bad
one
we
got
was
on
a
friday
night
and
it
just
needed
to
be
cooked
a
little
more
,
but
it
was
still
good
.

their
bbq
chicken
pizza
is
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
ever
had
.

horrible
service
!!!

absolute
horrible
service
from
the
parts
department
.

they
are
very
rude
over
the
phone
and
in
person
.

they
talk
down
to
you
like
they
are
supreme
beings
,
if
you
hate
your
job
so
much
then
quit
!!

how
these
guys
can
get
away
with
being
so
rude
with
people
is
mind
blowing
.

i
will
never
do
business
with
sun
toyota
again
.

thank
god
there
are
plenty
of
toyota
dealerships
to
choose
from
in
this
city
.

this
is
a
good
place

i
have
been
here
before
and
the
service
was
absoulutely
great
.

they
had
a
great
selection
of
colors
to
choose
from
and
their
seats
are
super
comfty
.

i
enjoy
going
there
although
i
've
only
been
there
once
,
i
will
be
returning
toda
to
recieve
a
pair
of
french
tips
and
i
will
only
go
to
the
best
and
to
me
the
best
is
here
.

i
reccomend
you
to
go
and
enjoy
their
wonderful
hospitality
.

anna
marie
and
govind
are
very
sweet
people
,
and
the
minute
you
steep
into
their
school
,
the
calm
loving
atmosphere
takes
over
,
and
tension
and
worries
stay
outside
in
the
street
,
whether
or
not
you
pick
them
up
again
after
class
is
probably
a
question
of
practice
.

a
wonderful
place
,
if
you
want
more
than
just
the
physical
side
of
yoga
.

give
yourself
the
gift
of
trying
this
place
,
to
see
if
it
fits
you
...

they
do
n't
seem
to
be
interested
in
selling
cars
.

went
there
yesterday
:
we
are
trying
to
decide
between
two
different
honda
models
,
so
we
wanted
to
test
-
drive
both
back
to
back
.

the
salesperson
refused
!

claimed
he
was
too
busy
for
two
test
drives
.

we
were
the
only
customers
there
!

do
n't
waste
time
,
just
drive
10
minutes
more
down
to
stevens
creek
,
they
actually
do
try
to
help
their
customers
there
!

ate
here
a
couple
times
.

it
is
not
a
high
end
steak
house
,
more
of
the
cuisine
brett
enjoys
in
mississippi
.

so
,
if
you
want
a
burger
and
fries
,
well
,
it
is
ok
.

if
you
want
a
little
cajunish
food
-
it
is
good
.

if
you
want
a
steak
,
well
,
this
is
not
the
best
in
green
bay
.

overall
decent
but
if
you
are
expecting
a
ruth
chris
type
steak
,
this
is
not
it
.

eulogic

good
place
to
be
on
a
sunday
night
.

the
beers
were
good
,
nice
choice
of
beers
as
well
,
and
as
usual
the
mussels
were
great
,
the
place
upstairs
is
a
nice
addition
to
the
bar
downstairs
.

filled
up
on
too
much
beer
and
hence
can
not
comment
on
the
food
.

but
the
menu
had
standard
stuff
that
one
would
get
at
a
belgian
tavern
.

if
you
are
a
handcraft
beer
person
,
this
is
a
fantastic
place
to
be
.

perfect
location
plus

i
moved
into
the
tanglewood
apartments
in
late
2008
and
it
's
been
a
refreshing
change
.

i
used
to
live
at
meadowrun
and
that
was
a
nightmare
.

the
manager
-
tiffany
-
is
actually
very
nice
so
i
'm
a
bit
surprised
by
other
comments
.

she
's
very
reachable
and
she
has
always
responded
quickly
to
any
questions
or
requests
.

plus
she
plans
a
monthly
breakfasts
and
other
events
at
the
clubhouse
which
is
a
nice
added
benefit
.

great
service
/
deals
-
support
this
local
business

i
have
used
these
guys
for
new
snows
,
fixing
lots
of
flats
,
used
replacement
tires
,
and
oil
changes
.

they
have
the
best
prices
locally
and
good
customer
service
.

one
guy
is
a
little
surley
,
but
who
gives
a
crap
as
long
as
your
car
's
work
is
outstanding
.

and
they
're
usually
able
to
help
you
as
a
walk
-
in
,
and
they
're
fast
.

overall
-
good
stuff
.

another
great
business
bites
the
dust
!

the
best
cakes
ever
!

a
bit
pricey
,
so
i
did
n't
go
very
often
,
but
it
was
always
a
treat
when
i
did
.

the
prices
were
worth
what
i
got
.

i
'm
assuming
they
are
completely
out
of
business
since
i
ca
n't
find
any
contact
information
.

i
'm
hoping
the
bakers
continue
to
do
their
baking
out
of
another
place
,
because
it
would
be
a
shame
not
to
have
these
cakes
any
longer
.

super
nice
people
,
really
good
food

what
i
love
most
about
this
place
,
other
than
the
food
,
is
that
eating
here
makes
you
feel
like
you
're
in
a
small
town
rather
than
baltimore
.

the
owners
are
really
nice
,
they
serve
good
food
at
a
good
price
,
and
the
option
to
eat
outside
on
the
deck
(
esp
on
the
weekend
whether
there
is
hardly
any
traffic
)
is
great
.

one
of
my
top
5
places
to
eat
in
baltimore
.

overpriced

this
place
is
identical
to
the
youngstown
sports
grille
,
so
i
imagine
they
are
owned
/
operated
by
the
same
people
.

the
food
is
mediocre
at
best
,
and
largely
overpriced
given
the
portion
size
and
quality
.

do
n't
even
get
me
started
on
how
expensive
it
is
to
drink
there
.

i
have
ate
here
3
times
since
they
first
opened
,
and
the
service
has
been
poor
each
time
,
the
staff
always
comes
across
as
somewhat
rude
and
slow
.

(

enjoyed
this
cozy
little
spot
with
a
group
of
8
folks
.

service
was
excellent
.

food
was
excellent
.

wine
was
excellent
.

i
was
feeling
the
need
for
some
fish
so
i
had
the
salmon
which
was
very
good
but
the
steaks
looked
amazing
and
if
i
am
in
town
again
,
i
'll
definitely
order
a
steak
.

a
perfect
place
for
a
romantic
dinner
.

lots
of
"
pretty
people
"
dining
inside
.

great
staff
.

very
helpful
!!!!

they
interviewed
me
,
gave
me
tests
in
the
software
i
included
on
my
resume
,
and
placed
me
in
a
position
that
i
kept
for
several
years
.

re-interviewed
and
am
going
on
interviews
for
a
new
job
.

i
'm
really
thankful
for
the
folks
at
hr
office
.

they
are
dependable
,
have
great
connections
in
the
community
,
and
are
a
great
resource
for
finding
a
job
.

i
highly
recommend
them
to
all
of
my
friends
!!!!
!

great
experience
-
consider
checking
out
their
puppies
before
buying
from
a
breeder
!

i
adopted
a
3.5
month
old
yellow
lab
last
winter
from
the
dumb
friends
league
.

the
staff
was
very
helpful
in
finding
the
right
dog
for
me
and
the
care
my
pup
received
was
outstanding
.

if
you
are
on
the
lookout
for
a
pure
breed
pup
do
n't
forget
to
check
out
the
shelters
!

my
pup
has
a
wonderful
temperment
and
has
been
a
wonderful
addition
to
my
family
!

food
good
,
service
poor

no
silverware
,
asked
for
a
spoon
for
my
son
s
mac
and
cheese
ended
up
having
to
use
my
tea
spoon
.

asked
for
bar
-
b
-
que
sauce
never
got
it
.

never
checked
back
with
us
once
we
got
our
food
.

had
to
go
the
the
bus
boy
s
station
ourselves
to
get
napkins
.

only
one
server
,
too
buys
talking
with
others
i
guess
.

food
was
good
,
but
service
means
a
lot
to
me
.

dr.
chao
you
are
the
best
dentist
i
have
ever
had
.

you
are
knowledgeable
,
professional
,
gentel
and
kind
.

i
wish
i
had
you
as
my
dentist
early
on
in
my
life
-
maybe
my
teeth
would
have
been
a
lot
better
then
they
are
now
,
however
i
am
glad
you
are
my
dentist
now
.

even
though
you
are
expensive
.

thank
you
for
helping
to
preserve
my
teeth
.

you
are
meticulous
in
your
work
and
it
shows
in
my
smile
.

con
garage

i
brought
my
car
in
for
a
simple
emissions
test
.

i
guess
they
figured
me
for
an
easy
mark
,
and
tried
to
explain
that
my
car
would
n't
pass
unless
i
replaced
a
hose
.

ten
minutes
later
,
i
took
my
car
down
the
street
and
it
passed
the
emissions
test
with
flying
colors
.

if
you
're
a
fan
of
herpes
,
being
ripped
off
,
and
child
molesters
,
this
is
the
garage
for
you
.

if
not
,
go
somewhere
else
.

rude
service

even
though
i
have
never
tried
hoa
salon
but
i
agree
with
other
reviewers
that
they
are
rude
.

i
called
and
asked
about
the
price
for
hair
updo
and
the
receptionist
or
owner
who
aswered
the
phone
refused
to
tell
me
,
or
even
just
give
me
an
approximate
price
range
.

he
told
us
to
stop
by
the
salon
and
then
he
will
tell
us
the
price
.

what
kind
of
rude
service
is
that
?

i
do
n't
want
to
waste
my
time
with
them
.

top
notch
eats
!

so
here
we
are
in
manson
.

manson
?

yes
,
manson
.

right
near
chelan
.

aka
nowheresville
.

and
this
litttle
gem
of
a
7
-
table
restaurant
is
a
complete
and
utterly
wonderful
surprise
.

a
short
but
wide
-
ranging
menu
executed
with
innovative
perfection
in
a
cozy
hole
in
the
wall
just
off
the
main
street
.

fantastic
food
served
without
pretense
,
very
reasonably
priced
wine
selections
.

a
great
place
to
go
for
dinner
after
a
day
of
wine
tasting
.

excellent
service
and
reasonable
prices

boutique
stores
dealing
in
children
's
clothing
/
gifts
are
often
outrageously
priced
(
who
wants
to
pay
40
dollars
for
a
newborn
onesie
?
)

but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
that
the
purple
goose
's
prices
are
reasonable
(
for
the
same
products
found
at
other
area
boutiques
,
the
prices
were
20
-
25
%
cheaper
)
.

the
service
was
also
excellent
-
friendly
,
helpful
and
informative
without
being
overbearing
.

will
definitely
return
.

consistantly
poor

a
lack
of
organisation
,
coupled
with
the
distain
for
its
customers
,
makes
this
the
worst
rental
agency
i
have
used
.

chasing
them
on
issues
from
the
day
i
moved
in
(
many
of
them
still
unresolved
as
i
left
)
to
all
sorts
of
farcical
issues
with
funds
,
after
i
left
.
.
.
.
as
soon
as
i
could
.

if
you
must
use
them
,
be
vigilant
and
be
ready
to
push
,
if
you
can
go
elsewhere
then
i
would
.

amazing
night
-
great
party
spot
!!

went
to
the
willow
lounge
this
past
weekend
for
dinner
and
drinks
...
place
is
awesome
.

had
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
a
/
c
broke
,
i
feel
bad
it
was
their
opening
!

anyway
,
once
that
is
fixed
,
this
place
will
be
amazing
.

drinks
were
awesome
,
prices
reasonable
,
and
staff
friendly
.

this
is
an
awesome
date
spot
that
the
area
seriously
needs
.

check
out
the
willow
lounge
,
you
ll
be
happy
!

it
s
been
a
few
years
since
i
have
been
to
ipanema
.

but
my
wife
and
i
first
went
there
thinking
it
would
be
brazilian
food
(
think
lots
of
meat
)
,
but
it
turned
out
to
be
a
vegan
restaurant
!

and
,
i
can
say
,
this
was
one
of
my
favorite
places
to
eat
in
all
of
richmond
.

amazing
!

do
n't
let
the
nondescript
building
entrance
fool
you
,
these
are
some
creative
and
talented
chefs
...
two
thumbs
way
,
way
up
!

excellent
food
,
fantastic
wait
staff

i
recently
threw
a
surprise
birthday
party
for
my
wife
at
fraiser
's
.

we
had
30
guests
for
the
event
,
and
everyone
came
away
from
the
evening
impressed
with
not
only
the
food
,
but
the
outstanding
service
as
well
.

the
management
was
easy
to
deal
with
during
the
planning
stages
,
and
the
execution
by
the
kitchen
and
wait
staff
was
flawless
.

i
highly
recommend
fraiser
's
for
anyone
planning
a
special
event
for
friends
,
family
or
business
.

fantastic
store
!!!

i
came
upon
this
store
as
the
building
caught
my
eye
.

it
's
located
in
the
huge
honka
log
homes
building
,
by
walmart
off
of
evergreen
parkway
.

the
store
was
decorated
with
furnishings
&
accessories
.

the
friendly
crew
working
was
great
&
very
helpful
.

this
store
is
what
colorado
is
all
about
.

also
,
i
purchased
some
furniture
last
year
and
all
has
been
great
!

it's
durability
&
look
was
perfect
and
i
will
definitely
be
adding
to
my
collection
soon
!

lovely
people
,
great
hats

i
was
saddened
to
see
the
reviews
that
claimed
world
hats
mart
has
poor
service
.

it
led
me
to
believe
that
the
reviewers
simply
had
difficulty
tolerating
people
with
strongly
-
accented
english
.

the
husband
and
wife
who
run
this
spot
are
lovely
people
.

we
have
had
many
conversations
with
them
and
they
have
always
been
extremely
patient
with
me
as
i
tried
on
multiple
hats
in
search
of
the
right
costumes
for
my
magic
act
.

i
recommend
them
highly
!

do
nt
ever
go
there
,
not
even
if
your
car
flips
.

their
service
sucks
to
start
off
with
,
people
are
cruel
and
ignorant
.

i
'm
compeltly
dissatisfied
with
their
service
and
their
products
.

they
do
not
have
a
return
policy
and
even
if
their
product
sucks
,
they
will
not
take
it
back
!

do
not
ever
go
here
.

i
prefer
advanced
auto
parts
over
this
crappy
place
with
the
meanest
people
.

and
they
thrive
to
get
a
customer
.

do
not
go
here
..
thank
you

horrible

i
have
been
growing
my
hair
out
for
1
year
plus
and
went
in
to
get
1
inch
taken
off
.

i
walked
out
with
5
inch
long
hair
on
the
top
,
2
inch
long
hair
on
the
sides
,
and
1.5
in
the
back
.

my
hair
is
uneven
and
it
looks
rediculous
.

this
woman
should
be
working
in
supercuts
...
if
that
.

this
was
a
terrible
experience
and
i
hope
that
no
one
else
goes
through
that
.

do
your
self
a
favor
and
do
not
go
to
this
establishment
.

the
worst
burger
king
restaurant
!!!

i
generally
like
the
bk
over
the
other
fast
serving
restaurants
;
however
,
i
regreted
to
visit
this
restaurant
at
my
town
.

this
is
a
shame
of
my
adorable
town
,
branford
.

i
ordered
a
kid
meal
with
a
milk
and
found
a
bottle
was
half
opened
already
.

i
asked
them
to
change
it
but
they
rudely
said
that
it
was
okay
.

disgusting
french
fries
is
very
best
menu
.

do
n't
go
,
or
you
will
learn
how
to
waste
your
money
.

disappointed

the
bad
:
i
was
at
napa
recently
and
was
unpleasantly
surprised
at
poor
waiter
svce
and
subpar
food
.

we
were
a
party
of
4
and
none
of
us
were
particularly
pleased
with
our
dishes
.

napa
is
all
about
wine
but
gives
very
short
descriptions
of
the
wines
on
their
lists
.

i
found
my
initial
selection
satisfactory
but
the
wine
flight
we
chose
to
be
poorly
composed
.

if
you
must
go
ask
lots
of
questions
about
your
selections
since
your
expectations
may
as
high
as
mine
were
.

highly
recommended

we
walked
in
to
pick
our
little
man
at
10
minutes
to
closing
and
heard
laughter
from
kids
and
the
staff
.

the
facilities
are
more
than
adequate
and
the
staff
are
just
phenomenal
.

their
sense
of
humour
and
calmness
when
dealing
with
the
little
ones
amazes
me
every
time
i
walk
in
.

we
have
since
moved
slightly
further
away
from
the
centre
but
it
's
worth
the
extra
travel
,
as
the
care
provided
exceeds
our
expectations
...
especially
after
a
few
horrendous
daycare
experiences
elsewhere
.

horrible
!!!!
!

this
has
to
be
some
of
the
worst
pizza
i
have
ever
had
the
misfortune
of
ordering
.

the
crust
was
lopsided
,
thicker
on
one
side
than
the
other
.

it
actually
had
a
hole
in
one
of
the
slices
.

there
was
minimal
cheese
and
sauce
and
it
completely
lacked
flavor
.

i
know
new
york
pizza
and
this
is
not
it
!!

this
was
nothing
like
new
york
style
pizza
!!!.

i
love
pizza
and
this
was
a
complete
and
utter
disappointment
!!

i
would
not
suggest
this
pizza
to
anyone
!!!

best
quote
ever
my
gate
was
stuck
halfway
open
so
i
called
a
class
garage
doors
dr
services
.

they
came
to
my
house
in
no
time
and
started
working
on
the
gate
.

they
were
very
friendly
and
were
able
to
explain
me
exactly
what
was
wrong
with
it
.

once
they
fixed
it
they
answetred
all
of
my
questions
with
no
hesitations
and
then
gave
me
the
best
quote
ever
.

i
know
that
if
my
garage
door
needs
to
be
repaired
,
i
will
be
calling
a
class
garage
doors

you
will
be
happy
at
this
store
!

allen
tire
was
recommended
by
friend
after
my
having
bad
tire
experiences
in
temecula
.

the
store
manager
,
jim
smith
,
made
an
excellent
tire
recommendation
for
my
newly
acquired
lexus
.

tires
were
the
right
price
and
now
the
car
feels
like
it
is
riding
on
rails
around
turns
.

the
store
is
clean
,
run
very
professionally
and
a
pleasure
to
be
in
.

they
know
their
job
and
you
do
not
have
to
watch
them
to
be
sure
everything
is
done
right
.

easiest
time
i
ever
had
purchasing
a
car
!

excellent
service
,
not
only
did
they
get
the
exact
car
i
wanted
win
in
48
hours
but
the
sales
man
also
took
me
out
to
lunch
.

very
kind
and
reliable
.

i
highly
recommend
this
dealership
if
you
would
not
like
to
hassle
on
price
and
receive
friendly
service
.

i
have
since
purchased
two
cars
from
this
dealership
,
the
first
one
was
from
phillip
and
the
second
was
from
richard
.

both
were
excellent
sales
men
who
put
my
needs
first
.

this
place
has
done
a
great
job
of
taking
care
of
the
usual
maintenance
on
my
hooptie
.

i
also
never
have
to
wait
long
for
a
yearly
inspection
sticker
...
and
never
get
the
usual
excuses
other
shops
always
gave
me
...
"
the
inspection
guy
is
n't
here
today
"
....
for
example
.

today
i
went
into
kwik
kar
and
there
were
two
cars
in
front
of
me
for
inspection
...
but
i
was
still
out
of
there
pretty
quick
...
barely
had
time
to
read
a
chapter
in
my
book
.

extremely
helpful
and
professional

as
first
-
time
home
buyers
,
my
husband
and
i
found
stephanie
fairchild
at
prudential
steamboat
realty
,
extremely
helpful
.

she
worked
with
us
for
over
a
year
,
helping
us
find
our
perfect
home
.

stephanie
's
knowledge
of
the
market
and
properties
in
our
price
range
,
made
us
feel
secure
in
our
decision
to
buy
when
we
did
.

we
would
highly
recommend
stephanie
to
anyone
looking
for
a
home
in
the
yampa
valley
.

we
appreciated
her
patience
,
knowledge
and
kindness
!

great
barber

firstly
,
the
other
reviewer
clearly
has
never
been
to
nick
's
,
or
he
would
know
that
nick
only
charges
$
13
for
a
haircut
which
is
pretty
much
industry
standard
.

i
have
been
going
to
nick
for
5
months
now
precisely
because
he
does
pay
attention
to
detail
.

i
have
terrible
hair
and
he
really
takes
his
time
to
make
it
look
right
.

some
of
the
younger
kids
that
work
there
are
a
bit
sub
par
,
but
if
you
wait
for
nick
...
you
'll
be
good
.

ugh
!!!

got
some
nice
"
freshly
baked
"
fruit
squares
,
a
personal
favorite
of
mine
.

took
a
bite
,
it
tasted
odd
.

flipped
the
square
over
and
saw
it
riddled
with
green
mold
!!!!

ugh
!!

i
called
the
store
and
the
clerk
giggled
,
and
agreed
that
it
was
gross
,
but
said
it
was
not
her
problem
.

she
also
refused
to
get
a
manager
.

i
left
my
number
,
or
tried
to
anyway
.

same
clerk
had
considerable
difficulty
taking
down
a
number
.

i
'll
never
go
back
there
again

for
cheap
chinese
food
,
this
is
the
place
to
go
.

i
used
to
eat
at
places
like
new
china
or
green
buffet
in
troy
,
mo
-
nothing
terrible
but
not
that
great
.

now
,
i
wo
n't
eat
fast
food
chinese
unless
it
's
from
this
place
.

the
best
value
i
've
found
from
a
chinese
restaurant
.

i
do
n't
live
in
lake
st.
louis
anymore
,
but
deliveries
were
always
correct
and
the
service
courteous
.

now
i
have
to
be
in
the
area
to
get
some
lovin'
:
sad
face
:

amazing
experience
!

my
experience
was
amazing
at
providence
aesthetics
and
medical
spa
.

jana
kueck
was
nothing
but
professional
.

she
makes
you
feel
like
you
are
the
most
important
person
in
the
world
.

jana
made
me
feel
very
comfortable
.

provided
me
with
warm
blanket
and
has
soft
music
playing
.

walking
in
the
door
you
are
made
to
feel
happy
and
relaxed
.

equipment
is
state
of
the
art
.

i
would
reccomend
anyone
to
go
see
jana
kueck
and
robin
talley
to
see
all
the
many
procedures
they
have
to
offer
.

dave
is
a
patient
and
methodical
teacher
,
who
has
a
great
ear
and
sensitivity
for
his
students
'
passion
and
the
direction
they
want
their
lessons
to
take
.

also
,
he
loves
teaching
so
much
,
his
price
is
unbeatable
,
but
that
does
not
change
his
level
of
skill
.

dave
has
much
to
offer
.

in
just
2
-
3
focused
lessons
,
i
'm
already
now
capable
of
picking
up
new
songs
off
youtube
guitar
how
to
videos
and
am
even
writing
my
own
orginals
with
confidence
!

we
love
our
new
roof
!

we
would
like
to
thank
you
for
the
roofing
job
you
did
on
our
home
.

everything
was
done
on
a
timely
manner
and
things
were
cleaned
and
picked
up
every
day
when
the
crew
was
done
.

we
also
liked
the
way
that
ray
checked
on
the
job
every
day
.

and
when
the
job
was
done
every
thing
was
cleaned
up
and
hauled
off
that
same
day
.

we
would
not
hesitate
to
use
spears
roofing
again
.

we
have
already
recommended
you
to
some
of
our
friends
!

omfg

i
fucking
hate
this
place
every
time
i
go
this
hot
chick
shows
up
and
i
mean
really
hot
but
she
is
like
reaaaally
dumb
and
then
their
is
this
other
chick
that
is
realy
ugly
but
she
is
like
super
smart
she
could
be
a
scientist
,
but
then
their
is
this
stoner
who
always
comes
here
high
and
he
always
brings
his
fucking
dog
who
is
so
high
from
the
second
hand
smoke
i
think
he
is
trying
to
talk
.

anyway
we
drive
around
in
my
van
and
solve
mysterys
and
shit

amazingly
yummy
!

i
just
got
back
from
france
yesterday
and
just
missed
the
food
already
!

my
sister
in
law
told
me
about
this
amazing
new
crepe
place
in
town
,
i
was
so
excited
i
just
wanted
to
go
and
test
it
out
for
my
self
!

their
customer
service
was
perfect
!

their
food
was
better
then
anything
i
had
ever
tasted
.

even
in
france
!

i
would
highly
recommend
this
place
to
anyone
looking
for
a
great
atmosphere
,
amazing
food
,
and
great
customer
service
!

thank
you
roll
up
crepes
!

this
is
one
of
the
worst
places
i
have
stayed
,
we
cut
out
stay
short
and
went
to
the
mulberry
.

even
though
they
still
charge
you
the
days
you
booked
but
wo
n't
use
,
it
is
worth
the
get
the
hell
out
of
this
crap
hole
.

the
whole
experience
shows
a
hotel
managed
by
what
must
be
a
2
star
hotel
manager
.

bad
service
starting
from
the
front
desk
.

the
best
person
is
the
valet
.

short
of
that
,
avoid
this
place
,
as
a
silver
marriott
member
,
this
is
a
disgrace
.

best
place
in
ames

i
lived
here
for
two
years
when
the
prices
were
a
little
lower
:)
the
places
are
very
nice
and
clean
,
and
in
great
condition
!

i
really
enjoyed
the
staff
at
wessex
,
also
the
manager
sherri
was
always
very
nice
and
helpful
.

the
fitness
center
was
great
!

the
only
problem
that
i
had
in
2
years
of
living
there
was
that
the
walls
are
pretty
thin
,
sometimes
i
could
here
my
neighbors
conversations
.

i
would
recommend
these
apartments
to
anybody
!

i
absolutely
loved
living
there
.

the
best
service
ever
!!

i
have
never
had
better
service
.

my
car
broke
down
and
roadside
towed
my
vehicle
to
sussman
kia
.

they
squeezed
me
in
and
had
me
back
up
and
running
in
no
time
.

everyone
was
pleasant
and
very
helpful
.

the
service
department
even
gave
me
a
ride
home
and
picked
me
up
when
my
car
was
finished
.

the
advisor
kept
me
up
to
date
and
informed
on
the
progress
of
my
vehicle
.

i
give
this
dealer
an
a
+
!

i
will
definitely
be
bringing
my
car
back
for
service
.

heaven
on
earthhhhhhh

place

in
here

friendly
,
fine
food

the
one
-
star
review
from
2005
is
out
of
date
.

there
was
a
change
of
ownership
a
couple
of
years
ago
and
service
is
both
quick
and
extremely
friendly
.

the
food
continues
to
be
very
good
--
deli
sandwiches
,
homemade
soups
,
fresh
salads
.

the
atmosphere
may
not
be
for
everyone
.

it
is
a
bustling
place
where
separate
parties
are
seated
at
the
same
table
(
as
in
many
european
cafes
)
,
but
if
you
are
ok
with
that
,
the
food
is
very
good
.

love
the
soups
.

the
new
italian
kid
on
the
block

another
italian
restaurant
in
collingswood
?

do
we
need
another
one
?

only
if
it
is
of
the
quality
of
that
's
amore
.

the
menu
has
the
usual
but
then
they
step
it
up
another
notch
.

the
arancini
di
riso
(
risotto
fritters
)
are
not
to
be
missed
.

chicken
saltimboca
was
excellent
and
then
there
's
the
chocolate
mousse
that
comes
straight
from
heaven
.

pay

a
very
satisfied
new
customer
!

as
a
very
satisfied
new
customer
,
i
wholeheartedly
recommend
united
air
duct
cleaning
.

they
are
professional
,
knowledgeable
,
and
take
meticulous
care
and
pride
in
accomplishing
their
work
.

not
only
were
my
wife
and
i
very
pleased
,
but
i
also
had
the
air
duct
quality
tested
professionally
by
the
home
inspector
that
i
regularly
use
,
before
and
after
united
air
duct
performed
their
work
.

based
on
the
test
results
,
the
home
inspector
stated
that
the
quality
of
their
job
was
"
excellent
"
.

the
best
breakfast
in
solana
beach
!

we
love
t
's
cafe
!

without
a
doubt
the
best
place
to
grab
a
tall
bloody
mary
and
some
eggs
benedict
.

t
's
has
been
a
north
county
landmark
for
thirty
years
and
with
good
reason
.

family
owned
and
operated
makes
sure
the
atmosphere
is
relaxed
and
the
food
home
-
cooked
with
style
.

i
highly
recommend
picking
up
a
jug
of
their
homemade
bloody
mary
mix
-
definitely
the
best
.

if
you
've
been
to
north
county
,
chances
are
it
's
in
your
favorites
list
already

prominent

prominent
builders
in
new
jersey
are
one
the
best
building
contractors
,
i
was
referred
to
them
by
my
friend
,
i
am
so
glad
i
used
them
for
my
home
renovation
,
and
addition
.

they
were
very
professional
,
respectful
,
completed
the
job
on
time
,
and
well
below
my
budget
.

mike
one
of
owners
was
awesome
,
he
explained
the
detailed
plan
,
and
executed
on
time
,
i
am
always
going
use
them
and
refer
them
to
many
friends
i
can
because
of
the
great
job
they
did
me
.

great
dude
cut
!

great
service
,
cool
vibe
,
impeccable
style
.

i
'm
a
guy
with
tricky
hair
so
getting
that
right
is
job
1
.

after
going
through
5
other
places
i
finally
found
janice
at
alta
moda
.

not
only
was
it
a
good
cut
but
my
wife
and
friends
comment
on
my
hair
every
time
i
leave
...
saying
it
's
the
best
look
i
've
ever
had
.

either
i
suck
at
my
own
style
or
janice
is
a
genius
.

looks
like
there
's
a
lot
of
talent
in
this
place
.

worth
every
penny
.

my
favorite
place
at
wildwood

i
have
been
going
to
the
wildwood
,
nj
for
over
30
years
for
summer
vacations
and
always
call
the
madrid
first
.

i
rated
it
5
stars
.

i
am
not
saying
it
is
a
5
star
hotel
.

i
am
saying
when
comparing
all
other
hotels
in
wildwood
,
this
hotel
has
everything
that
we
are
looking
for
.

it
is
the
hospitality
from
tom
and
staff
,
that
makes
it
feel
like
a
5
star
hotel
in
the
middle
of
the
beach
.

we
prefer
the
layout
of
rooms
and
it
is
always
clean
.

when
in
scordia
,
sicily

if
ever
in
sicily
please
take
the
time
to
visit
anna
maria
jose
mudo
and
her
familia
.

they
are
and
always
will
be
the
nicest
people
in
sicily
that
you
will
meet
.

you
will
also
have
the
pleasure
of
learning
the
italiano
language
.

you
will
also
have
the
experience
of
learning
the
bella
sicilian
culture
,
that
i
have
fallen
in
luv
with
.

i
will
4
-
ever
be
eternally
grateful
for
their
hospitality
and
luv
that
my
sicilian
family
showed
me
when
i
was
there
for
3
years
.

luv
always
..

i
've
never
felt
the
need
to
write
a
review
or
make
a
complaint
before
,
but
after
the
way
i
was
spoken
to
by
a
member
of
staff
at
the
kennels
(
whose
name
i
believe
to
be
mrs
closs
)
i
would
now
not
recommend
this
business
to
anybody
.

if
the
animals
are
treated
in
the
same
way
the
customers
are
treated
then
this
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
!

nobody
should
be
spoken
to
like
that
regardless
of
how
bad
their
day
may
have
been
or
what
may
be
going
on
in
their
private
lives
!

best
car
dealer
in
tx

i
purchased
a
nissan
from
this
dealship
.

the
sales
men
were
very
knowledgeable
about
every
aspect
of
every
car
we
looked
at
.

they
were
very
patient
and
helpful
from
showing
the
cars
to
doing
the
paperwork
.

the
paperwork
was
a
very
easy
and
smooth
.

they
tried
to
run
my
credit
score
as
less
as
possible
so
it
wo
n't
hurt
my
score
.

overall
,
i
was
very
happy
with
the
customer
service
and
my
purchase
.

if
you
're
looking
to
buy
a
car
,
definitely
give
them
a
call
.

they
have
a
huge
inventory
.

i
have
been
a
patient
a
nw
hospital
and
it
was
great
.

i
have
also
had
an
80
yr
old
that
i
take
of
sent
to
the
er
and
long
stays
in
the
hospital
.

yes
,
we
had
to
wait
,
but
er
is
a
triage
system
that
takes
the
most
life
threatening
cases
first
.

any
er
would
be
the
same
.

as
far
as
being
treated
like
a
drug
seeker
,
that
has
not
been
my
experience
.

as
a
nurse
i
know
about
drug
seekers
.

this
is
a
great
hospital
and
even
better
since
it
became
part
of
the
uw
system
.

wonderful
experience

i
had
immense
pain
on
a
sunday
morning
,
with
friends
and
family
telling
me
that
i
would
never
find
a
dentist
on
a
sunday
.

dr.
taylor
was
not
only
available
on
a
sunday
,
but
also
was
able
to
immediately
take
care
of
me
.

he
was
incredibly
informative
about
the
options
i
had
,
giving
me
opinions
on
different
treatments
to
choose
from
.

coming
from
a
person
who
hates
the
dentist
in
general
,
dr.
taylor
was
the
best
!

he
really
made
the
visit
a
pain
free
one
with
excellent
service
!

i
would
recommend
him
to
everyone
!

horrible

this
school
is
the
worst
one
i
've
ever
been
to
.

i
attended
it
for
2
years
,
and
that
was
enough
.

there
's
holes
everywhere
in
the
ceiling
,
sewage
constantly
leaks
through
the
ceiling
,
and
the
whole
condition
of
the
school
is
horrible
.

the
staff
and
the
principal
are
rediculous
,
they
do
n't
listen
to
any
input
,
and
they
make
up
rediculous
rules
(
they
banned
backpacks
,
because
a
teacher
tripped
over
a
student
's
)
.

the
education
is
horrible
at
best
,
do
society
a
favor
,
and
do
not
send
your
student
here
.

excellent
customer
service
and
quality
work
.

they
went
the
extra
mile
to
repair
my
cowboy
boots
--
they
had
to
have
a
special
kind
of
paper
that
looked
like
wood
grain
to
fix
the
heels
.

that
was
4
years
ago
.

i
have
n't
been
able
to
find
a
shoe
repair
place
in
seattle
since
that
has
been
able
to
do
it
.

(
i
've
been
through
at
least
5
places
already
.
)

if
i
had
time
to
drive
to
tacoma
before
they
closed
during
the
work
week
,
i
would
just
so
i
could
get
those
boots
fixed
properly
again
.

so
handy
for
local
la
jolla
stuff
-
especially
for
finding
residential
numbers

since
moving
back
from
college
and
trying
to
settle
roots
in
the
village
,
i
have
referred
to
the
la
jolla
blue
book
for
a
ton
of
local
numbers
.

the
white
pages
allowed
me
to
get
in
touch
with
parents
of
my
high
school
friends
so
that
i
could
track
people
down
one
by
one
and
the
restaurant
section
is
basically
my
cookbook
.

it
's
really
cool
that
so
many
local
businesses
are
found
so
quickly
in
one
place
and
i
want
to
spread
the
word
.

thx
:-)

the
staff
do
occasionally
get
game
info
correct
,
but
if
you
r
looking
fot
a
good
game
and
are
n't
a
nerd
,
do
nt
ask
them
.

the
last
time
i
did
that
i
was
suggested
to
buy
oblivion
when
i
told
them
i
was
looking
for
a
fps
.

i
knew
what
it
was
and
told
the
guy
that
it
was
n't
a
fps
.

he
tried
to
tell
me
it
was
when
i
told
asked
him
if
he
knew
what
fps
stood
for
and
he
had
no
clue
.

overall
they
are
n't
very
knowledge
about
the
type
of
games
are
on
the
market
.

first
and
last
time
we
'll
eat
there

my
friend
and
i
went
there
for
lunch
today
.

neither
one
of
us
had
ever
been
-
so
we
thought
we
'd
try
it
.

big
mistake
-
the
food
was
tasteless
and
cold
.

we
both
kept
trying
to
find
something
we
liked
.

the
only
thing
i
found
edible
were
the
potato
wedges
,
i
finally
gave
up
,
he
kept
trying
-
he
found
the
fried
wantons
to
be
ok
-
his
mongolian
bowl
was
awful
.

would
not
recommend
this
place
to
anyone
-
in
fact
-
save
your
money
and
go
somewhere
else
.

liquidweb.com
rocks
!!!

i
am
not
a
client
of
liquidweb.com
,
but
one
of
my
friend
called
steven
is
the
client
having
several
websites
.

i
work
with
him
and
since
past
6
years
he
is
hosting
his
websites
to
liquidweb
.

as
i
have
gone
through
many
reviews
sites
to
see
if
any
provider
is
providing
better
services
or
not
,
and
i
have
realized
that
there
were
many
good
reviews
about
liquidweb
also
steven
never
faced
any
server
issues
in
his
whole
hosting
.

the
kind
of
support
they
provide
is
simply
great
!!!

i
would
like
to
host
my
upcoming
website
to
liquidweb.com

,
this

hands
-
down
the
best
pasta
and
gnocchi
i
've
ever
eaten
(
and
i
've
eaten
a
lot
)
.

the
antipasti
were
amazing
,
the
wines
were

blowing
,
the
service
could
n't
have
been
better
.

i
've
dined
at
lots

and
i
've
never
before
felt
my
money
was
so
well
spent
.

great
prices
,
great
service
!

i
've
been
to
this
shop
twice
(
once
for
an
inspection
and
again
for
an
oil
change
)
and
they
truly
live
up
to
their
name
:
discount
!

they
have
all
kind
of
coupons
available
for
car
washes
,
oil
changes
,
state
inspection
,
etc
.

the
thing
is
,
you
still
get
high
quality
service
at
nicely
discounted
rates
!

there
is
even
free
coffee
and
bottles
of
water
if
you
'd
like

the

is
a
pleasant
guy
and
i
would
trust

any
of

top

all
the
way

david
is
amazing

david
is
the
most
helpful
and
creative
photographer
that
i
have
used
.

he
is
willing
to
do
whatever
you
need
from
him
without
hesitation
.

he
was
patient
and
adapted
when
everything
did
n't
go
according
to
schedule
on
my
wedding
day
.

both
the
engagement
and
wedding
pictures
that
he
took
for
us
we
absolutely
amazing
.

he
got
the
pictures
back
to
me
quickly
.

i
would
highly
recommend
david
to
anyone
.

he
will
exceed
your
expectations
!

he
does
n't
just
take
pictures
he
makes
art
out
of
them
and
you
wo
n't
even
notice
that
there
's
a
camera
there
.

not
so
great

my
husband
just
got
a
bike
there
as
a
gift
he
's
only
had
it
a
month
.

it
's
a
nice
bike
and
it
cost
a
lot
of
money
.

but
just
this
week
a
peddle
broke
.

he
took
it
back
and
they
would
not
honor
a
warranty
and
said
it
was
his
fault
because
of
his
shoes
??

so
they
were
going
to
charge
him
for
new
peddles
and
proceeded
to
put
them
on
without
even
telling
him
the
price
.

which
was
very
expensive
.

he
asked
for
a
different
pair
instead
and
they
only
gave
him
five
dollars
off
??

trek
is
not
so
great

only
concerned
with
money

i
have
been
getting
my
treatments
for
a
few
months
now
and
have
seen
some
results
but
not
up
to
the
standards
that
i
was
told
i
should
expect
.

the
people
there
attempt
to
come
across
and
professional
and
nice
,
but
i
was
disappointed
with
their
customer
service
.

never
miss
an
appointment
because
they
will
charge
you
the
price
of
a
treatment
,
even
if
you
had
an
emergency
.

it
's
pretty
ridiculous
!

they
want
to
squeeze
as
much
as
they
can
from
you
even
if
you
just
got
in
a
car
accident
!!!!

they
do
n't
care
one
bit
about
you
!!!!!

terrible
service
!!!

made
an
appointment
to
have
them
come
to
the
house
to
discuss
curtain
options
and
give
an
estimate
.

they
sent
over
someone
who
said
he
knows
nothing
about
curtains
and
could
not
show
me
fabric
options
or
give
an
estimate
.

when
i
called
the
manager
to
complain
,
she
said
she
knew
the
guy
did
n't
know
about
curtains
and
that
the
usual
lady
called
in
sick
hours
earlier
!

instead
of
rescheduling
they
chose
to
waste
my
time
instead
.

so
what
was
the
point
of
the
appointment
!?!

to
just
come
over
and
hang
out
?!?

i
will
never
do
business
with
this
company
!

ever
!!!

internet
department
is
rude
and
insulting

i
was
looking
to
bring
a
customer
to
their
lot
to
buy
a
car
but
the
internet
salesperson
last
name
is
balazick
sent
me
this
email
"
and
if
it
was
worth
my
time
i
would
of
bothered
aswering
your
questions
.

i
make
money
not
deal
with
brokers
"
wow
,
can
you
believe
in
today
s
tough
times
this
dealership
would
be
looking
for
any
way
to
move
vehicles
.

as
a
previous
internet
manager
i
would
deal
with
anyone
looking
to
buy
a
car
for
a
profit
and
not
care
if
they
came
in
with
a
broker
.

stay
away
from
this
dealership
!!!

this
place
is
a
rip
-
off

i
brought
a
car
in
to
have
the
"
check
engine
"
light
diagnosed
back
in
march
of
2010
.

they
said
it
was
"
plugs
and
wires
"
and
quoted
me
$
330
to
do
the
work
,
including
parts
.

i
asked
why
so
high
and
they
said
it
was
due
to
the
labor
of
moving
things
out
of
the
way
.

those
things
ended
up
being
a
windsheild
washer
fluid
tank
(
1
screw
)
and
the
air
filter
canister
(
4
spring
clips
)
.

i
did
the
work
myself
for
$
50
.

there
's
no
excuse
for
that
kind
of
estimate
.

my
girlfriend
and
i
took
a
chance
on
this
place
because
we
did
n't
want
to
wait
in
line
at
outback
.

what
an
amazing
find
-
this
restaurant
is
a
gem
.

1
it
s
immaculately
clean
.

2
the
decor
is
tasteful
and
artistic
,
from
the
comfortable
chairs
to
the
elegant
light
fixtures
....
and
(
most
importantly
)
3
the
food
is
fantastic
.

this
is
authentic
cuban
cuisine
;
fresh
ingredients
expertly
prepared
and
seasoned
perfectly
.

the
portions
were
generous
and
we
got
out
for
less
than
the
cost
of
one
entree
at
some
chain
restaurant
.

try
this
place
-
you
'll
love
it
.

thank
you
for
helping
me
get
more
healthy
!

i
came
in
and
saw
dr.
ruona
about
a
month
ago
for
quitting
smoking
.

i
have
to
tell
you
that
i
have
n't
had
one
and
do
n't
want
one
.

it
is
the
easiest
thing
that
i
have
ever
done
and
i
tell
all
my
friends
that
they
should
do
it
too
.

i
sent
a
customer
of
mine
to
you
.

dr.
ruona
,
if
you
read
this
,
thank
you
for
helping
me
get
more
healthy
.

i
feel
lighter
and
feel
that
i
have
more
possibilities
open
to
me
now
than
i
did
before
.

i
ca
n't
thank
you
enough
.

fantastic
for
kids

if
you
have
children
or
are
just
a
real
animal
lover
yourself
you
'll
love
this
zoo
.

it
's
only
$
10
and
in
essence
just
one
big
petting
zoo
.

they
sell
feed
and
milk
bottles
at
the
front
and
i
recommend
you
buy
lots
.

we
took
our
7
month
old
and
she
laughed
and
giggled
when
(
very
harshly
i
might
add
)
grabbing
and
'
kissed
'
the
goats
and
lambs
.

the
animals
were
all
very
sweet
and
patient
with
her
.

among
the
animals
that
were
available
to
touch
were
pony's
,
camels
and
even
an
ostrich
!!!

wonderful
,
inexpensive
and
lots
of
fun
!

wow
!!!

i
ca
n't
say
enough
good
things
about
karla
and
the
wonderful
things
she
has
done
for
me
and
my
dog
gracee
.

gracee
is
more
excited
to
see
her
than
she
is
to
see
me
!!!!

she
has
always
been
there
for
gracee
even
for
last
minute
calls
!

she
has
taken
care
of
my
sweet
girl
for
almost
4
years
now
and
i
would
not
let
gracee
go
with
anyone
besides
her
!!!

she
is
caring
,
punctual
,
and
very
enthusiastic
about
her
job
!

you
should
give
her
a
try
-
it
's
worth
every
penny
to
know
that
you
pet
is
in
great
hands
with
wunderbar
pet
sitting
!!!!

worst
service
i
've
ever
experienced

i
wish
there
was
something
good
to
say
about
the
business
,
but
unfortunately
,
there
is
n't
.

1
)
service
and
manners
were
nonexistent
.

2
)
the
employees
constantly
talk
down
to
customers
and
are
very
argumentative
for
the
sake
of
being
argumentative
.

(
to
both
myself
and
customers
)
3
)
i
have
never
experienced
so
much
rudeness
coming
from
a
business
.

4
)
the
business
is
very
unorganized
.

the
invoice
is
not
detailed
,
so
it
is
difficult
to
see
what
you
are
paying
for
.

i
'd
recommend
to
save
your
time
and
energy
and
find
another
greek
store
.

exile
is
the
best
!!!

exile
is
the
longest
lasting
and
most
authentic
punk
store
in
richmond
!

i
have
been
shopping
there
for
over
six
years
now
.

the
staff
is
incredibly
friendly
and
helpful
and
the
owner
,
mimmy
,
is
an
absolute
angel
.

the
mark
up
is
minimal
considering
that
the
clothing
is
hard
to
find
and
often
shipped
for
europe
.

in
addition
,
the
clothing
is
of
much
better
quality
than
the
clothing
from
hot
topic
,
which
is
made
as
cheaply
as
possible
by
people
living
in
horrible
conditions
in
asia
.

exile
is
environmentally
conscious
and
involved
heavily
in
our
community
.

over-rated

buddakan
inevitably
attracts
the
majority
of
its
guests
simply
because
of
its
association
with
steven
starr
,
but
that
does
n't
impress
me
.

the
atmosphere
alone
deserves
4
stars
but
,
the
food
was
not
up
to
par
with
the
price
tag
and
the
reputation
the
restaurant
carries
.

the
server
we
had
was
knowledgeable
but
he
was
not
as
proper
as
he
should
have
been
,
acting
like
he
was
talking
to
his
friends
rather
than
his
customers
.

the
angry
lobster
was
completely
over-priced
!

$
80
for
a
dish
that
has
about
one
small
lobster
tail
and
is
full
of
filler
vegetables
!

i
would
n't
go
there
again
.

alto
delivers
on
all
levels
.

from
the
moment
you
enter
the
restaurant
,
you
know
you
are
some
place
special
.

the
service
is
impeccable
,
and
the
food
is
even
better
.

i
highly
recommend
the
four
-
course
tasting
menu
,
which
gives
you
plenty
of
range
and
food
to
satisfy
your
appetite
.

also
,
if
you
are
into
wine
,
alto
has
the
depth
of
both
region
,
varietal
,
and
vintage
to
satisfy
nearly
any
sommelier
(
or
after
9
pm
,
bring
your
own
bottle
for
free
...
no
corking
fee
!
)
.

while
it
's
not
cheap
,
alto
will
give
you
an
experience
you
'll
never
forget
.

the
landlord
is
not
nice
nor
helpful

i
have
lived
in
buckingham
condominiums
townhouse
for
2
years
.

i
love
the
location
and
the
apartment
!!

i
'm
a
single
female
and
i
feel
safe
coming
home
at
night
.

the
maintenance
people
are
awesome
!!!!

and
the
exterminator
is
very
nice
,
also
.

yes
,
you
still
have
a
few
bugs
,
but
that
's
going
to
be
anywhere
you
go
!

the
only
problem
that
i
have
experienced
is
the
landlord
.

she
is
a
pure
b****
!!!

i
know
that
's
ugly
...
but
she
wo
n't
help
you
out
for
anything
...
sad
story
.

other
than
that
,
i
would
recommend
living
here
.
:)

the
staff
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
.

the
front
staff
has
seen
quite
a
bit
of
turnover
and
changed
from
professional
to
rude
.

a
simple
follow
-
up
phone
call
with
a
woman
quickly
turned
into
a
nightmare
.

she
may
be
the
reason
for
all
the
change
.

i
sincerely
wonder
if
the
doctor
has
a
clue
about
what
is
going
on
within
his
practice
.

if
he
does
know
and
approves
of
this
behavior
then
it
is
a
poor
reflection
on
him
.

sometimes
it
is
not
worth
it
to
go
through
that
kind
of
staff
and
their
personal
attitude
to
get
to
a
doctor
.

he
was
an
okay
doctor
but
not
worth
her
.

wonderful
wild
wildernest
inn

i
would
give
the
wildernest
inn
ten
stars
of
five
!

atop
spring
mountain
,
from
the
decks
of
the
west
porch
,
"
one
can
see
forever
"
a
scene
of
unparalleled
beauty
and
grandeur
.

i
saw
deer
frequently
,
in
fact
a
small
herd
were
grazing
near
the
lodge
.

there
were
occasional
bears
on
the
deck
in
the
morning
.

and
most
correctly
,
us
visitors
did
not
mingle
with
the
native
wildlife
.

it
would
have
been
more
than
one
could
bear
!

kathy
and
stewart
,
the
proprietors
were
the
epitome
of
perfection
.

delightful
,
hospitable
,
superb
,
cozy
and
comfortable
.

i
hope
to
be
back
!

junkie
lube
?!

really
weird
place
,
i
was
driving
home
from
work
thought
i
'd
stop
in
for
an
oil
change
and
well
,
there
are
a
few
guys
in
jiffy
lube
uniforms
sitting
at
the
table
drinking
beers
and
shooting
the
breeze
.

the
neon
lighting
sign
still
said
"
on
"
yet
some
guy
who
seemed
to
be
the
oldest
of
the
bunch
,
more
like
the
drunkest
of
the
bunch
told
me
they
'd
be
open
tomorrow
.

i
asked
if
a
manager
was
on
duty
he
told
me
he
was
.

wow
!

grey
shirt
"
mark
"
of
course
with
this
type
behavior
he
could
have
been
wearing
someon
else
s
clothing
.....

a
friend
and
i
recently
took
our
16
and
18
month
olds
here
.

while
there
was
n't
too
much
available
for
their
age
(
ball
pit
,
bouncy
area
and
a
little
padded
pyramid
to
climb
on
)
,
we
went
right
when
they
opened
at
10
am
on
a
winter
weekday
and
ended
up
being
the
only
ones
there
,
so
we
were
given
a
little
more
liberty
than
we
would
have
if
others
had
been
there
.

it
's
not
the
classiest
place
,
but
it
was
cleaner
than
i
expected
and
the
staff
was
very
friendly
.

for
$
4
it
was
a
nice
break
from
the
monotony
of
winter
indoors
with
a
toddler
.

restored
my
faith
in
mechaincs
.

i
spent
3
months
going
from
shop
to
shop
trying
to
get
my
ferrari
to
run
and
drive
the
way
it
should
.

i
was
about
to
give
up
when
i
met
jason
and
neal
.

they
took
on
the
challenge
of
making
my
ferrari
all
i
dreamed
of
and
more
.

the
crew
at
the
creative
workshop
went
over
and
above
the
call
of
duty
and
gave
me
back
a
car
i
can
drive
anywhere
and
finally
enjoy
owning
.

i
can
not
say
enough
about
this
place
.

they
have
restored
my
faith
in
mechanics
.

do
yourself
a
favor
,
call
these
guys
first
and
enjoy
driving
your
car
again
..

a
great
vacation
!

we
wanted
to
see
the
sun
-
and
we
also
got
much
more
!

excellent
chefs
are
in
the
kitchen
preparing
memorable
breakfasts
.

after
a
train
ride
over
the
mountains
,
we
enjoyed
hiking
in
the
flower
-
filled
wenatchee
hills
(
in
may
)
and
a
very
interesting
bike
ride
in
a
loop
around
the
columbia
river
...
and
then
wine
if
we
wanted
it
on
the
patio
in
the
evening
....

this
is
a
busy
group
of
hosts
they
are
also
running
a
restaurant
,
which
also
must
be
wonderful
-
so
just
ask
for
what
you
need
,
and
i
'm
sure
they
will
do
their
best
to
be
hospitable
.

omg

omg
..
make
sure
to
book
a
reservation
,
as
this
magical
place
is
packed
(
in
a
nice
way
)
i
love
that
the
owner
walks
around
and
cares
how
his
customers
feel
about
their
food
.

the
waiters
are
like
no
other
...

my
waiter
was
so
excellent
i
gave
him
a
75
%
tip
,
and
it
was
worht
every
penny
..

the
food
was
finger
licking
the
bowel
fantastic
..

i
just
discovered
her
has
a
place
right
near
my
work
(
color
me
phat
)
if
you
are
looking
for
a
romatic
place
with
the
best
food
and
service
in
the
valley
giovanni
ristorante
should
be
your
number
1
+
2
choice
.

holly
is
truely
the
best
hairstylist
!

i
have
lived
in
the
utc
la
jolla
area
for
many
years
,
and
i
never
new
this
salon
was
here
until
a
friend
reffered
me
to
see
holly
here
.

i
was
very
pleased
with
my
experience
here
.

all
of
the
people
were
friendly
and
welcoming
.

i
got
highlights
,
haircut
,
and
a
blowdry
.

she
did
a
great
job
!

holly
is
very
experienced
and
talented
,
and
i
could
tell
she
new
what
she
was
doing
right
off
the
bat
.

my
hair
looks
amazing
,
and
i
get
compliments
all
the
time
.

i
deffenitly
reccomend
this
salon
and
holly
to
anyone
.

you
will
not
be
disappointed
!!!!!!

outdated
but
not
bad

so
i
really
felt
like
this
place
was
extremely
outdated
especially
since
the
pictures
make
it
look
nice
and
modern
.

it
had
listed
that
there
was
a
hot
breakfast
but
all
this
meant
is
that
they
added
a
waffle
maker
to
the
common
continental
affair
at
most
cheap
hotels
.

the
family
suite
was
basically
two
rooms
with
a
small
opening
between
them
which
worked
great
for
us
because
we
were
two
families
traveling
together
.

if
you
are
in
town
and
need
that
kind
of
space
i
say
stay
here
but
if
you
are
looking
for
a
little
more
upscale
affair
do
n't
let
the
pictures
fool
you
and
book
somewhere
else
.

great
,
and
probably
the
only
west
indian
spot
worth
hitting
up
in
nashville
.

i
was
born
and
raised
in
toronto
,
which
has
a
huge
west
indian
(
trinidadian
,
jamaican
,
etc
)
population
.

so
huge
in
fact
,
that
toronto
slang
is
influenced
by
and
has
jamaican
references
,
and
jamaican
beef
patties
are
staples
in
my
high
school
cafeteria
.

anyway
,
i
was
practically
raised
on
this
stuff
,
and
being
a
connoisseur
of
west
indian
cuisine
,
jamaica
way
is
a
bit
toned
down
to
suit
the
american
palette
.

all
you
have
to
do
to
make
it
authentic
jamaican
food
,
is
add
a
whole
lot
of
pepper
.

a
lot
.

the
finest
christmas
trees
i
've
ever
seen
.

i
felt
like
i
was
in
heaven
when
i
walked
through
the
majestic
fields
of
this
particular
farm
.

the
trees
were
in
magnificent
shape
and
the
variety
was
astounding
.

the
owners
were
entertaining
and
gracious
.

i
especially
liked
the
eco
friendly
atmosphere
and
the
owner
s
love
of
all
animals
.

this
is
one
of
the
best
farms
i
have
ever
been
too
.

i
would
call
it
the
taj
mahal
of
the
east
coast
!

it
put

pho
-
nomenal
!!

i
have
been
eating
pho
for
almost
my
entire
life
and
i
've
always
gone
to
the
pho
places
in
south
philly
and
off
the
boulevard
and
even
the
other
one
in
chinatown
,
but
when
i
tried
this
pho
place
,
it
blew
the
other
pho
houses
away
!!

all
of
the
pho
places
taste
the
same
to
me
,
so
what
seperates
one
from
the
other
is
the
service
and
the
price
.

the
service
here
is
incredible
compared
to
the
other
places
.

the
only
down
fall
of
this
pho
house
is
the
difficulty
in
finding
parking
in
chinatown
.

remember
to
bring
cash
since
they
do
n't
take
debit
or
credit
.

hope
this
helps
!!

had
a
horrible
experience
with
a
manager
here
,
rachel
mcinnis
,
she
was
rude
,
inconsiderate
and
did
not
do
the
right
thing
for
an
item
that
was
marked
incorrectly
...

i
'm
not
interested
in
shopping
in
a
place
with
people
like
her
...
she
refused
to
sell
me
the
item
at
its
marked
price
even
after
admitting
they
had
made
a
mistake
.

i
normally
do
n't
write
reviews
but
seeing
that
i
considered
dillards
a
distinguished
,
upscale
place
to
shop
,
this
one
wo
n't
be
getting
my
business
,
nor
my
family
's
,
nor
my
co-workers
.

it
's
never
ok
to
let
a
customer
walk
out
unhappy
,
especially
when
they
are
right
.

highly
recommend

i
work
as
a
transformational
life
coach
.

since
this
is
an
alternative
therapy
i
always
refer
clients
to
a
lisenced
therapist
when
i
feel
that
is
appropriate
.

i
found
her
through
a
colleague
one
day
when
one
of
my
clients
was
in
the
midst
of
a
panic
attack
and
needed
professional
help
that
i
am
not
qualified
to
provide
.

little
did
i
know
that
i
would
soon
be
needing
her
help
as
well
!

she
guided
me
through
a
very
difficult
period
dealing
with
a
family
member
's
suicide
,
coupled
with
elder
abuse
.

i
found
her
to
be
extremely
solid
,
kind
,
compassionate
,
and
intuitive
as
well
.

i
would
recommend
her
highly
!

they
wo
n't
have
a
second
chance
from
me
.

first
,
let
me
state
that
although
i
live
in
nyc
,
i
am
not
from
nyc
,
i
do
n't
care
about
baseball
and
i
absolutely
love
boston
to
death
(
so
beautiful
,
so
clean
,
so
awesome
)
.

that
said
,
i
hated
this
restaurant
.

the
service
was
just
about
as
good
as
i
'd
get
in
nyc
(
that
means
it
was
poor
)
and
the
food
was
almost
mediocre
.

the
decor
left
a
lot
to
be
desired
and
the
posters
telling
me
all
the
reasons
99
was
great
just
served
as
an
ironic
contrast
against
the
reality
.

personally
i
recommend
you
take
your
money
elsewhere

when
i
arrived
at
brickell
honda
on
6/4/11
,
i
was
greeted
and
attended
to
by
the
sales
manager
,
gustavo
guerra
,
in
a
very
friendly
and
professional
manner
.

i
explained
to
him
what
i
wanted
and
that
i
previously
went
to
braman
honda
.

bramen
honda
was
a
bit
of
a
hassle
.

he
told
me
"
no
problem
,
we
will
match
the
offer
or
do
better
.
"

mr.
guerra
gave
me
a
better
deal
without
any
hassles
nor
any
type
of
problems
.

brickell
honda
has
been
the
best
buying
experience
in
the
world
.

i
urge
all
st.
thomas
the
apostle
parishioners
and
all
of
south
florida
residents
to
come
see
gus
!!!

excellent
customer
service
!!!

great
,
honest
service

i
took
my
2001
nissan
frontier
in
to
fix
a
cracked
manifold
.

the
dealer
wanted
$
1300
to
fix
that
and
another
$
1500
to
fix
some
other
things
.

eagle
transmission
determined
that
much
of
the
work
the
dealer
said
needed
to
be
done
was
unneccesary
and
what
needed
to
be
fixed
was
only
$
400
!!

i
was
so
impressed
with
the
honesty
and
integrity
of
mike
and
everyone
at
eagle
transmission
!

i
dropped
the
truck
off
in
the
morning
and
it
was
ready
that
afternoon
.

i
have
finally
found
a
mechanic
i
trust
!!

and
it
was
great
that
they
did
not
charge
a
service
fee
to
diagnose
the
problem
-
an
added
bonus
!!

dr.
shady

kelly
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
.

"
dr.
shady
"
is
a
jerk
.

after
the
way
she
spoke
to
me
on
my
last
visit
,
i
will
not
be
returning
!!

good
luck
keeping
business
with
that
stuck
up
attitude
dr.
shady
.

you
have
just
lost
mine
.

the
next
time
you
feel
like
being
condescending
to
someone
,
it
is
not
going
to
be
me
!!!!!!

dr.
shady
is
inexperienced
and
prideful
.

she
probably
does
not
even
have
10
%
of
the
knowledge
that
some
of
the
other
experienced
vets
do
in
this
area
.

i
will
be
carefully
researching
vets
before
i
take
my
dog
someplace
else
.

beautifully
written
reviews
doctor
,
but
completely
untrue
.

poor
experience

i
did
not
have
a
good
experience
w
/
dr.
ghassemlou
.

during
the
session
,
he
demanded
to
have
my
physical
address
,
which
i
've
always
kept
private
as
i
am
enrolled
in
a
witness
protection
program
.

i
believe
he
is
correct
in
that
he
needs
my
physical
address
for
legal
reasons
,
however
,
he
did
not
adequately
explain
this
during
our
session
.

i
learned
more
about
this
doing
my
own
research
afterward
.

i
think
he
could
've
done
more
to
assuage
my
concerns
by
giving
me
concrete
facts
.

saying
that
i
need
to
give
him
my
address
or
else
i
have
intimacy
issues
is
not
helpful
.

it
's
pretty
combative
actually
.

you
'll
love
it

i
have
had
my
back
fused
in
2
places
.

i
wish
that
i
had
n't
done
this
.

with
these
fusions
,
chiropractric
is
n't
as
successful
,
but
it
still
is
very
helpful
.

even
after
my
fusions
,
my
back
continued
to
hurt
,
but
now
it
does
n't
hurt
any
more
.

i
would
encourage
anyone
who
is
thinking
of
back
surgery
,
to
talk
about
different
treatment
options
first
with
dr.
de
barros
.

he
really
knows
what
he
is
talking
about
and
will
approach
the
different
options
fairly
.

you
can
see
different
treatments
that
a
surgeon
ca
n't
see
,
so
that
you
can
have
several
treatment
options
before
you
decide
what
to
do
.

unbelievably
huge
experience
for
such
a
small
salon
!!!

i
have
been
to
kim
at
cheveux
for
more
than
five
years
.

i
can
not
tell
you
how
often
i
am
complimented
on
my
hair
(
style
and
color
)
!

i
regularly
request
kim
's
business
cards
as
i
am
often
stopped
on
the
street
and
asked
"
who
does
your
hair
...
i
love
it
!!!
"

quaint
,
lovely
,
small
salon
with
big
personality
.

i
am
made
to
feel
special
when
i
am
in
the
chair
and
i
have
never
had
a
less
than
amazing
cut
or
color
experience
.

my
hair
has
never
felt
this
healthy
,
either
.

i
can
not
recommend
this
salon
enough
!!!

thanks
cheveux
!

my
favorite
in
mclean

my
family
loves
coming
to
endo
sushi
.
they
are
very
nice
,
it
is
never
crowded
,
and
the
food
is
wonderful
,
very
delicious
and
fresh
!

sometimes
it
is
hard
to
get
parking
in
the
lot
in
front
of
the
storefront
,
and
it
is
on
a
one
-
way
street
,
but
the
restaurant
itself
is
never
overcrowded
.

if
you
can
not
park
in
the
lot
,
then
you
can
park
in
the
shopping
center
's
garage
,
and
walk
up
to
endo
sushi
.

the
service
is
fast
.

be
sure
to
ring
the
little
bell
on
your
way
out
if
you
enjoyed
your
meal
!

(
it
's
by
the
door
,
on
the
hostess
stand
)

horrible
service
!

i
got
yelled
at
,
literally
yelled
at
because
i
asked
if
i
could
pick
up
my
car
5
-
10
minutes
late
.

i
explained
that
i
was
already
on
my
way
and
i
would
rush
to
get
there
as
soon
as
i
could
because
i
needed
my
car
for
work
at
5
am
,
but
the
guy
was
arguing
with
me
saying
he
was
gon
na
lock
the
doors
right
at
5:30
.

rude
,
unprofessional
,
just
jerks
.

seems
like
all
they
care
about
is
the
money
and
getting
home
on
time
,
no
care
for
the
customers
at
all
!!!

missed
a
whole
day
of
work
because
i
am
now
carless
.

i
will
neeeeeeeeeverrrr
go
to
this
place
again
.

superb
arrangements

i
used
fancy
flowers
for
my
late
husband
's
funeral
flowers
as
they
had
been
recommended
to
me
.

i
am
so
glad
that
i
called
in
to
see
ana
,
she
is
a
lovely
girl
who
showed
nothing
but
care
and
compassion
towards
me
.

the
flowers
were
all
that
i
hoped
they
would
be
,
i
have
attended
several
funerals
of
late
unfortunately
and
the
flowers
i
recieved
from
ana
outshone
them
all
.

she
is
so
talented
,
the
flowers
were
arranged
superbly
and
delicately
,
it
is
so
obvious
to
see
the
difference
between
someone
fully
trained
and
skilled
compared
to
others
.

thank
you
ana
i
hope
to
see
you
in
the
future
under
better
circumstances
.

great
first
experience
.

i
'm
22
,
and
my
hairdresser
was
great
(
and
not
"
old
"
like
one
of
the
reviews
says
)
-
she
really
listened
to
what
i
wanted
and
gave
me
tons
of
tips
on
how
to
style
my
hair
so
i
could
get
it
to
look
the
way
i
wanted
it
to
.

she
deep
conditioned
my
hair
and
took
the
time
to
style
it
properly
.

she
recommended
products
but
absolutely
did
n't
pressure
me
to
buy
.

it
's
a
cute
place
with
a
really
friendly
,
laid
-
back
atmosphere
.

i
would
highly
recommend
it
and
will
be
going
back
for
my
next
haircut
.

oh
!

and
students
get
$
5
off
,
ca
n't
argue
with
that
.

smoker
s
haven

yeah
,
this
complex
is
not
very
good
.

our
bathroom
fan
,
one
electric
outlet
and
2
leaky
sinks
have
yet
to
be
fixed
.

both
bathrooms
look
like
they
were
flooded
and
the
wood
cabinets
are
thrashed
at
the
bottom
and
they
slapped
some
pieces
of
wood
over
to
try
to
cover
it
up
.

and
non-smokers
beware
!!!

i
think
90
percent
of
the
tenants
are
smokers
!

if
you
do
not
smoke
,
do
not
move
here
.

our
unit
reeks
of
old
cigarette
smoke
and
it
started
to
become
apparent
a
few
weeks
after
we
moved
in
.

you
can
not
walk
5
feet
without
smelling
that
disgusting
cigarette
smoke
and
it
blows
right
into
the
windows
all
day
and
all
night
.

great
sanwiches
,
great
prices

i
used
to
go
here
almost
every
day
since
i
work
in
the
neighbourhood
and
loved
their
turkey
and
meatball
sandwiches
.

chicken
salad
salad
is
great
too
.

best
of
all
,
the
staff
is
quick
on
their
feet
and
even
with
long
lines
,
usually
serve
you
in
5
minutes
or
less
.

for
the
quality
,
the
prices
(
$
4
-
$
6
)
have
to
be
the
best
in
town
.

the
staff
get
to
know
regulars
and
do
their
job
very
well
.

tourists
like
the
other
reviewer
might
not
appreciate
their
efficiency
or
quality
,
but
i
certainly
do
.

this
is
n't
a
tgif
or
cafe
,
it
s
a
lunch
sandwich
place
and
a
good
one
at
that
.

rate
a
church
?

might
as
well
just
hotpot
the
curb
and
rate
the
traffic
light
.

it
's
a
bloody
church
,
for
chrisssake
!

big
,
grey
and
imposing
.

go
there
on
christian
holidays
for
a
bit
of
churchy
grandure
.

the
pastor
at
this
church
is
cool
,
i
met
him
after
some
holiday
service
.

he
had
a
robe
that
was
made
back
in
the
'60s
.

god
was
pleased
with
that
one
!

it
's
historical
for
sf
,
so
when
your
aunte
comes
for
a
visit
,
take
her
there
.

great
for
the
kiddies
-
they
love
the
labyrinth
(
do
n't
forget
to
tell
'em
it
s
really
a
'
pagen
'
thing
!
)
.

stop
by
at
least
once
or
you
'll
go
to
heck
!

ok
but
just
becuse
we
where
on
a
tight
budget
.

me
and
my
dad
where
in
nj
for
a
kc
chiefs
(
my
home
team
)
vs
the
ny
jets
and
for
game
4
of
the
world
series
.

i
'm
a
red
sox
fan
so
i
was
glad
that
the
phillies
won
.

the
knights
inn
was
small
very
small
.
i
mean
1
room
in
every
room
!
it
was
cozy
a
little
and
a
small
tv
.

i
mean
a
2
day
stay
was
a
ok
stay
even
tho
the
manager
looked
like
he
was
chineze
and
that
we
only
slept
and
went
out
from
8
to
7
to
see
new
york
.

but
sice
we
almost
just
slept
there
i
ca
nt
give
that
good
of
a
review

it
was
a
saturday
and
my
spring
was
broken
...

i
googled
garage
door
repair
in
woodinville
and
found
ndi
-
johnette
answered
the
phone
and
was
oh
-
so
pleasant
and
helpful
!

she
sort
of
appologized
for
dan
taking
the
day
off
to
go
skiing
-
but
he
could
do
the
repair
on
sunday
!

i
said
great
and
dan
arrived
on
time
at
10
am
to
make
the
repair
.

i
enjoyed
speaking
with
dan
,
and
learning
more
about
how
the
springs
are
sized
for
these
doors
.

the
repair
went
quickly
and
the
price
was
extremely
fair
.

i
would
highly
recommend
ndi
-
and
will
spread
the
word
to
my
neighbors
.

thanks
dan
and
johnette
for
your
responsiveness
and
professional
service
.

roger
m.
,
woodinville

i
would
n't
send
my
dogs
there
.

i
had
a
conversation
with
the
woman
running
this
place
in
april
2010
.

she
basically
said
if
the
children
getting
off
the
bus
are
n't
paying
to
enter
her
building
she
was
going
to
let
them
wander
around
the
streets
.

wow
,
really
?

with
all
the
child
predators
out
there
,
a
busy
road
,
cars
speeding
by
......
and
you
are
going
to
let
some
4
/
5
year
olds
wonder
around
cause
you
're
money
hungry
?

real
christian
of
you
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

whether
they
pay
me
or
not
,
if
their
parents
get
into
an
accident
,
stuck
in
traffic
,
etc.
the
last
thing
i
would
do
is
let
a
child
get
raped
because
i
was
n't
paid
.

excellent
service

i
could
easily
go
to
nordstrom
for
my
designer
jeans
and
pay
the
same
price
,
but
i
go
to
the
garment
district
for
their
service
.

previous
reviewers
said
they
were
pushy
and
i
can
understand
that
,
but
i
find
the
staff
more
helpful
than
anything
else
.

tiffany
is
fabulous
!

i
came
in
for
alterations
(
free
,
by
the
way
)
and
told
her
about
a
stain
i
had
on
my
new
leather
purse
.

she
immediately
went
to
the
back
,
brought
out
leather
cleaner
and
cleaned
my
purse
on
the
spot
.

i
did
n't
even
buy
the
bag
there
!

huge
selection
and
,
great
suggestions
from
the
staff
and
they
refer
you
to
reliable
places
if
they
do
n't
have
what
you
need
.

we
were
expecting
a
great
experience
,
when
we
recieved
a
friendly
greeting
by
the
hosts
.

the
atmosphere
was
nice
and
very
clean
.

the
menu
had
plenty
of
options
even
for
picky
eaters
.

the
service
was
ok
,
our
waitress
kept
forgetting
our
drinks
even
though
we
reminded
her
several
times
.

to
start
we
tried
the
guacamole
and
salsa
verde
,
it
was
completly
flavorless
.

we
should
have
left
then
.

we
orderd
our
meals
anyway
,
chimichangas
,
jalapeno
borritos
,
and
quesadillas
.

everything
was
bland
,
completely
void
of
any
spice
or
flavor
.

we
have
never
had
mexican
food
this
bad
,
it
was
just
simply
gross
.

hopefully
they
spice
things
up
or
they
wo
nt
be
in
business
long
.

i
recommend
la
hacienda

might
try
again

pros
:
*
jill
,
the
owner
,
is
very
nice
and
really
cares
about
her
feedback
*
pretty
nice
atmosphere
*
great
dessert
*
not
your
typical
veggie
selection
,
i
like
!

do
n't
know
where
else
you
can
find
purple
hull
peas
and
some
of
the
other
sides
.

cons
:
*
server
was
n't
very
pleasant
*
pretty
small
portion
on
the
blackened
catfish
*
overcooked
food
*
time
,
took
about
25
minutes
from
ordering
to
eating
.

half
the
tables
and
bar
were
empty
by
this
point
.

other
thoughts
:
will
try
this
place
again
.

there
must
be
a
reason
so
many
people
like
it
there
.

their
club
sandwich
looks
tasty
,
maybe
that
'll
change
my
mind
....
and
a
different
server
.

very
professional
/
very
helpful

the
people
at
fidelity
leasing
were
very
friendly
and
helpful
.

i
was
looking
for
a
car
but
did
not
really
know
what
i
wanted
and
they
were
very
helpful
and
took
the
time
to
first
figure
out
what
my
needs
were
and
showing
me
various
options
to
meet
those
needs
.

they
seemed
more
interested
in
helping
me
find
the
right
car
rather
then
just
make
a
sale
.

my
experience
with
them
was
great
-
low
stress
,
very
helpful
and
very
personal
.

after
finding
the
car
i
wanted
they
took
the
time
to
go
over
each
step
and
making
it
as
painless
as
possible
.

from
start
to
finish
they
were
top
notch
.

i
would
highly
recommend
calling
these
people
up
for
your
next
car
.

this
insurance
co.
is
a
joke
!!!

they
have
absolutely
no
communication
skills
whatsoever
.

if
you
do
n't
mind
being
robbed
,
cheated
or
lied
to
then
this
is
the
company
for
you
.

they
will
make
every
attempt
to
misinform
and
misrepresent
themselves
.

they
make
up
excuses
in
hopes
to
confuse
their
policy
holders
with
misinformation
.

as
an
example
they
took
payment
for
5
out
of
6
monthly
plan
premiums
for
a
yearly
policy
and
cancelled
the
contract
for
the
remainder
of
the
policy
for
reasons
they
stated
was
not
receiving
information
on
other
licensed
drivers
in
the
household
?

i
personally
provided
the
request
on
four
separate
occasions
and
they
claim
there
is
a
glitch
in
their
systems
?

ifa
is
an
acronym
for
i
m
a
f%#king
assh@%$e
!!!

fantastic
service
!

i
have
been
here
a
few
times
for
oil
changes
and
just
got
my
tires
,
alignment
and
state
inspection
done
yesterday
.

i
shopped
it
around
and
they
were
extremely
competitive
in
pricing
and
also
added
nitrogen
to
my
tires
which
should
extend
the
life
and
get
me
better
gas
mileage
.

it
also
came
with
free
balance
and
rotation
for
the
life
of
the
tires
!

what
made
it
perfect
was
that
they
offered
transportation
so
that
i
would
not
have
to
wait
there
or
take
time
off
of
work
to
go
back
and
forth
or
try
to
find
a
ride
.

great
service
,
great
pricing
and
super
convenient
!

i
also
did
not
feel
like
they
tried
to
sell
me
a
bunch
of
services
that
i
did
not
need
.

love
my
home
at
creekside

i
moved
to
creekside
apartments
in
august
2008
with
a
6
-
month
lease
and
have
just
extended
it
for
another
13
months
!

the
management
from
julie
and
janice
to
the
work
staff
,
esp.
edwin
,
are
just
wonderful
.

they
have
been
extremely
helpful
whenever
i
have
asked
for
help
.

although
the
apartments
are
facing
stokes
street
and
close
to
the
bascom
light
rail
,
the
location
is
surprisingly
quiet
.

i
have
never
had
any
problems
with
loud
neighbors
or
concerns
about
safety
.

the
apartments
are
within
walking
distance
to
trader
joe
's
,
whole
foods
,
and
other
stores
.

the
well
-
equipped
,
clean
gym
is
a
plus
!

great
place
to
live
if
you
work
in
and
around
downtown
san
jose
!

i
interviewed
several
contractors
for
a
kitchen
remodel
.

liberty
construction
shows
up
and
it
's
two
guys
...
all
i
get
is
100
%
sales
pitch
"
we
're
the
best
...
we
're
number
50
so
we
must
be
doing
something
right
...
look
at
all
these
certificates
that
say
we
're
great
"
.

not
once
did
i
feel
listened
to
like
they
actually
cared
about
what
i
wanted
,
all
they
were
interested
in
was
me
signing
a
contract
right
then
and
there
.

very
high
pressured
sales
and
with
the
reviews
of
many
others
bad
service
.

i
'm
glad
i
trusted
my
gut
and
did
n't
get
sucked
into
doing
business
with
them
.

find
someone
you
trust
that
actually
hears
you
and
wants
to
do
the
job
right
.

do
n't
waste
your
time
or
money
!

i
took
my
3
year
old
son
here
at
the
weekend
and
to
be
honest
,
apart
from
the
shark
walkway
,
i
thought
it
was
rubbish
and
overpriced
.

even
taking
into
account
the
fact
that
my
3
year
old
wanted
to
run
most
of
the
way
round
,
it
took
us
just
over
one
hour
start
to
finish
.

if
you
have
been
to
the
london
aquarium
i
would
not
even
bother
with
this
.

if
you
are
really
desperate
for
something
to
pass
the
time
and
are
willing
to
shell
out
the
best
part
of
l
30
for
2
two
people
then
go
for
it
.

(
for
some
reason
it
will
not
let
me
rate
it
one
star
-
it
is
not
rated
5
by
me
!

cranmore
dental
and
implant
clinic
:
i
could
not
recommend
dr
david
nelson
enough
.

i
had
a
severe
phobia
of
attending
the
dentist
until
i
met
and
was
treated
by
dr
nelson
.

he
instantaneously
put
me
at
ease
and
his
ongoing
treatments
have
been
absolutely
pain
free
.

my
previous
apprehension
has
been
dismissed
and
i
no
longer
have
a
sinking
feeling
when
my
next
appointment
is
due
!

in
addition
to
the
core
treatment
,
dr
nelson
has
impressed
me
further
with
his
concern
and
interest
in
the
well
-
being
of
his
patients
-
his
dental
work
underpinned
by
a
strong
duty
of
care
to
every
patient
.

he
is
always
prepared
to
go
the
extra
mile
to
ensure
that
any
patient
discomfort
is
dealt
with
immediately

pam

best
salsa
(
hehehe
)

after
my
trees
were
cleaned
up
,
they
gave
me
a
jar
of
salsa
.

the
owner
warned
me
that
it
was
the
best
salsa
i
would
ever
had
,
and
he
was
right
.

no
joke
!

i
hate
to
say
check
them
out
just
for
the
salsa
,
but
james
,
i
need
another
jar
badly
:)
all
kidding
aside
,
they
are
a
very
good
company
,
i
have
a
hard
time
giving
any
service
biz
a
5
star
review
but
they
came
close
.

very
affordable
(
do
n't
call
it
cheap
)
and
their
trimmers
were
quick
and
courteous
when
i
got
home
from
work
.

and
the
salsa
,
be
sure
to
ask
for
a
jar
and
have
plenty
of
chips
around
,
you
will
need
them
.....

dr.
mann
killed
our
pet

yea
,
dr.
mann
ai
n't
so
great
.

we
took
our
beloved
kitty
to
him
and
it
came
back
dead
.

we
live
in
the
sub-division
around
the
corner
and
after
it
happened
and
we
brought
it
up
at
some
neighborhood
gatherings
we
discovered
that
several
people
from
this
neighborhood
alone
had
pets
go
to
dr.
mann
for
surgical
procedures
and
came
back
dead
.

if
you
take
him
here
for
shots
,
no
big
deal
but
i
would
never
let
this
man
apply
anesthetic
to
my
pet
ever
again
.

oh
,
they
also
charged
me
for
the
procedure
(
$
250
)
and
had
the
audacity
to
charge
me
a
$
25
'
disposal
'
fee
.

they
actually
itemized
it
as
a
disposal
fee
.

avoid
at
all
costs
.

one
of
the
worst
places

this
place
and
its
sister
store
peking
garden
are
the
worst
places
to
order
from
.

the
food
was
horrible
not
cooked
like
it
should
be
,
they
got
the
order
wrong
on
a
number
of
occasions
,
and
once
forgot
about
my
order
.

i
had
to
call
back
up
there
two
hours
later
and
the
lady
(
who
claimed
to
be
a
manager
)
said
my
food
was
on
the
way
,
and
she
did
nt
offer
to
compensate
me
in
any
kind
of
way
.

i
waited
another
30
mins
before
receiving
my
food
and
it
was
cold
.

in
my
opinon
this
place
should
be
shut
down
by
the
health
inspector
,
and
anyone
who
is
satisfied
with
there
service
and
food
has
never
eaten
at
a
real
asian
restaurant
.

gone
downhill
since
change
in
ownership

sigh
.

i
used
to
love
this
place
.

but
now
that
they
are
part
of
a
chain
,
service
has
slipped
.

i
am
waiting
longer
at
bna
for
my
pickups
and
last
time
i
parked
with
them
,
they
lost
my
car
key
.

lucky
i
had
a
spare
with
me
!

to
date
they
have
not
made
good
by
either
finding
the
key
or
paying
for
a
new
one
.

(
these
new
car
keys
are
expensive
to
copy
,
you
ca
n't
just
go
to
walmart
.
)

go
to
the
website
for
coupons
and
join
the
club
-
you
can
get
free
parking
.

however
,
with
bna
offering
one
day
of
free
parking
due
to
construction
of
the
new
rental
car
facility
,
it
may
be
cheaper
to
park
at
bna
.

wife
and
i
attempted
to
adopt
a
dog
and
was
nothing
but
frustrating
.

we
arrived
sunday
at
about
230
and
found
a
do
we
really
liked
.

we
were
told
that
we
could
n't
today
because
they
were
closing
soon
.

i
called
the
next
morning
to
let
then
know
my
wife
would
be
driving
in
.

they
gave
me
the
run
around
and
missing
paperwork
only
to
call
back
to
tell
me
someone
else
wanted
her
and
i
would
need
to
come
in
and
put
down
a
deposit
.

i
work
2
hours
away
but
offered
my
card
over
the
phone
.

they
refused
.

terrible
communication
as
well
.

at
one
point
they
told
me
the
dog
had
been
fixed
,
the
next
day
it
had
n't
.

huge
ammount
of
time
wasted
time
and
elevated
blood
pressure
.

college
is
a
joke
and
the
salon
is
a
joke
!

went
to
the
school
here
over
priced
!!!!!!

you
do
not
learn
the
things
you
were
promised
.

you
have
to
bring
in
your
own
models
and
they
have
to
pay
for
you
to
use
them
if
you
do
nt
then
you
can
graduate
!

going
back
after
graduating
you
r
told
you
get
a
discount
on
services
nope
you
do
nt
.

staff
is
under
educated
.

going
there
you
learn
the
school
does
not
care
about
the
services
given
just
about
the
money
.

over
priced
for
students
to
learn
!

beware
of
the
nail
program
you
are
not
taught
to
use
a
nail
drill
at
all
you
learn
the
old
fashioned
way
of
doing
nails
you
will
not
be
able
to
do
well
in
a
salon
!!!

beware
!

you
can
fool
people

this
store
is
proof
that
you
can
fool
people
with
good
advertising
.

they
convince
lots
of
people
that
they
are
a
great
store
,
when
in
fact
they
are
a
very
average
place
at
best
,
they
are
just
another
big
box
store
like
the
others
.

they
offer
sales
that
are
n't
really
sales
,
mislabeled
items
that
make
the
item
sound
like
a
good
deal
when
it
is
n't
,
a
bad
attitude
about
return
items
,
and
on
and
on
.

with
higher
than
average
prices
to
boot
!

so
do
n't
get
taken
in
,
keep
your
eyes
open
if
you
choose
to
shop
here
.

on
the
other
hand
,
the
richmond
ukrops
chain
is
known
for
its
charity
work
,
its
community
action
,
and
its
interest
in
the
public
welfare
.

never
again

do
n't
go
here
unless
you
want
to
sit
,
order
,
eat
and
be
asked
to
leave
all
in
a
matter
of
20
minutes
.

you
wo
n't
even
have
time
to
read
the
entire
menu
before
being
asked
to
order
and
if
you
ask
for
more
time
your
server
will
wait
at
the
table
.

this
is
the
only
place
i
have
ever
eaten
and
been
told
to
leave
because
other
people
were
waiting
.

i
was
told
to
take
my
coffee
to
go
if
i
wanted
to
finish
it
.

oh
,
and
their
liquor
license
was
expired
so
no
bloody
mary
or
mimosas
.

plus
the
drinks
are
self
service
,
have
fun
trying
to
negotiate
the
small
cafeteria
space
to
get
your
coffee
,
juice
or
water
.

go
next
door
to
the
ball
square
cafe
instead
.

i
guess
you
get
what
you
pay
for
.

i
tried
to
stay
here
for
a
few
nights
with
my
girlfriend
,
so
we
asked
for
a
single
queen
bed
.

we
got
there
,
and
we
were
treated
to
the
free
"
upgrade
"
of
a
room
with
two
double
beds
.

since
they
consider
this
an
upgrade
,
they
let
their
other
rooms
fill
up
and
would
not
change
our
room
.

then
we
got
put
in
a
room
with
a
huge
gap
under
the
door
....
right
next
to
the
ice
machine
.

we
could
hear
every
single
thing
that
happened
outside
like
it
was
inside
our
room
.

when
i
finally
found
someone
at
the
desk
who
could
speak
english
,
they
moved
our
room
,
but
we
still
did
not
receive
the
single
queen
we
had
"
reserved
"

i
was
thoroughly
impressed
!

i
had
a
problem
with
the
tile
in
my
bathroom
coming
apart
.

i
called
a
few
different
businesses
in
the
area
to
get
estimates
,
they
were
n't
the
cheapest
i
found
but
very
reasonable
.

the
best
part
is
i
got
my
whole
bathroom
remodeled
for
about
the
same
price
the
other
compan's
were
quoting
just
to
fix
the
shower
tile
and
fixtures
.

they
had
the
work
done
in
about
half
the
time
quoted
which
made
me
and
my
wife
extremely
happy
.

we
have
had
nothing
but
compliments
on
our
bathroom
when
guest
come
over
-
who
would
have
guessed
that
one
?

very
nice
work
and
friendly
guys
too
.

best
money
i
've
spent
on
remodeling
ever

i
highly
recommend
any
one
considering
home
repair
to
give
these
guys
a
call
.

new
training
centre
is
excellent

the
award
dance
centre
has
moved
from
its
holderness
road
site
to
a
new
complex
on
chamberlain
road
hull
.

the
new
centre
has
4
studios
planned
and
now
boasts
the
largest
single
dance
floor
area
in
kingston
upon
hull
.

the
classes
cover
all
age
and
skill
ranges
,
with
ballroom
,
latin
,
sequence
,
street
,
disco
,
line
dancing
,
ballet
,
tap
&
jazz
.

we
have
attended
a
ward
dance
centre
for
over
a
year
and
really
enjoy
the
friendly
and
welcoming
way
we
are
taught
ballroom
and
latin
as
well
as
the
fun
filled
social
dance
evening
held
every
saturday
evening
....

it
is
not
really
possible
to
score
this
school
too
highly
,
we
would
give
it
12
out
of
10
and
5
stars
across
the
board

&
anne

i
purchased
a
2
-
year
old
certified
pre-owned
bmw
from
this
dealership
.

the
night
i
drove
back
home
,
i
found
that
the
rear
window
has
some
leakage
.

(
you
can
hear
the
wind
while
driving
on
highway
.

very
likely
it
needs
a
new
window
seal
)
.

i
admit
that
i
should
have
paid
attention
to
this
kind
of
little
things
while
test
drive
.

(
but
this
is
a
certified
car
from
a
dealer
.
)

so
i
brought
the
car
back
the
second
day
.

they
told
me
that
this
is
not
under
warranty
and
want
to
charge
me
$
175
just
to
diagnose
the
problem
!

who
knows
how
much
they
want
me
to
pay
to
fix
this
thing
.

i
walked
away
.

so
my
advice
is
that
never
trust
this
dealer
.

stay
away
as
far
as
possible
.

perfect
practice

after
i
had
chosen
the
fountain
dental
practice
they
provided
a
slick
and
professional
service
from
start
to
finish
.

everyone
was
friendly
from
the
receptionist
to
the
surgeon
herself
,
putting
me
at
my
ease
and
explaining
the
whole
process
,
both
initially
and
then
as
we
went
along
.

surgery
visit
timings
were
always
made
to
suit
me
and
not
them
and
they
gave
me
the
feeling
that
i
mattered
and
was
important
to
them
.

the
surgery
itself
is
slick
,
modern
and
very
relaxed
and
i
always
felt
that
i
was
in
capable
hands
.

my
dental
surgeon
,
dr.
lucy
nichols
is
clearly
a
dental
perfectionist
and
clearly
proud
both
of
the
work
she
does
and
the
reputation
she
has
established
.

everyone
was
so
helpful
that
i
can
not
wait
to
go
back
.....

wonderful
service
for
large
group

i
had
my
wedding
luncheon
at
this
bj
s
restaurant
,
and
it
was
one
of
the
best
choices
that
i
made
.

it
was
a
great
deal
--
we
paid
a
certain
amount
per
person
,
and
my
husband
and
i
chose
4
types
of
pizza
and
the
servers
brought
out
as
much
as
we
wanted
.

we
were
also
served
salad
and
soda
.

we
had
a
large
party
,
about
fifty
people
or
so
,
and
yet
everything
was
served
quickly
and
we
all
had
a
wonderful
time
.

even
though
we
were
only
supposed
to
have
those
specific
types
of
pizza
,
when
guests
asked
for
a
different
type
,
it
was
brought
out
with
no
charge
to
us
!

i
really
appreciate
bj
s
for
making
that
special
day
even
better
with
their
wonderful
food
and
service
.

wonderful

i
went
to
ohm
after
reading
some
of
the
reviews
.

i
go
to
school
in
the
area
and
usually
wait
until
i
go
home
to
get
my
hair
cut
.

i
decided
it
was
time
to
grow
up
and
made
an
appointment
.

sierra
was
my
stylist
and
i
love
what
she
did
.

i
have
wavy
hair
and
she
cut
to
my
hair
style
.

it
was
the
first
time
i
had
left
a
salon
with
my
hair
curly
.

usually
they
blow
dry
it
out
and
i
have
to
wait
until
i
wash
it
to
see
what
it
will
look
like
in
its
natural
state
.

but
she
did
a
fabulous
job
letting
me
know
what
she
was
doing
at
all
times
and
styled
my
hair
in
a
way
i
could
do
it
at
home
.

it
was
n't
completly
impossible
!!!!

i
am
definitely
going
back

after
recently
relocating
to
south
bend
,
we
were
looking
for
a
delicious
,
fun
,
yet
elegant
establishment
for
new
year
s
eve
dinner
.

we
were
disappointed
with
this
holiday
dinner
due
to
the
overall
flavor
and
price
of
the
meal
,
and
accessibility
to
the
jazz
club
.

the
meal
was
extremely
overpriced
and
lacked
flavor
,
especially
for
being
a
special
nye
menu
.

the
limited
menu
had
few
appetizing
options
and
the
nye
special
packages
were
way
overpriced
.

after
our
meal
,
our
server
found
us
a
table
in
the
jazz
club
where
we
were
informed
it
would
be
another
$
10
/
person
to
stay
and
listen
to
the
band
,
despite
the
fact
we
had
just
finished
a
dinner
there
and
were
intending
to
enjoy
their
drink
list
.

this
was
a
less
than
impressive
experience
at
trio
's
.

run
for
the
hills
...
you
'll
be
much
better
off
!

one
night
was
too
much
.

first
room
had
used
tissues
next
to
the
bed
and
i
requested
it
be
rectified
.

i
was
then
moved
to
another
room
around
the
back
where
the
room
was
dirty
,
the
shower
was
dirty
with
other
people
s
hair
in
it
,
the
toilet
seat
was
peeling
and
rough
and
the
bathroom
was
full
of
mould
.

i
called
reception
to
ask
if
they
knew
the
state
the
room
was
in
and
was
told
"
this
is
a
days
inn
,
not
the
hilton
"
and
the
receptionist
then
hung
up
on
me
.

to
warn
you
to
stay
away
from
this
place
just
is
n't
enough
.

there
was
not
one
ounce
of
caring
involved
and
anyone
i
can
warn
about
the
complete
lack
of
service
will
be
warned
.

grocery
and
daily
needs
store

before
using
fusionretail
before
installing
fusionretail
store
was
running
on
a
dos
based
software
.

we
were
having
a
major
problem
in
maintaining
cash
.

being
a
grocery
shop
,
maintaining
5000
different
products
was
a
challenging
job
.

managing
pos
counter
without
barcoding
was
really
a
tough
time
.

how
fusionretail
has
overcome
these
issues
?

fusionretail
helps
us
to
maintain
the
store
in
an
organised
way
.

usage
of
product
barcodes
and
smooth
maintenance
of
inventory
with
proper
recording
of
transactions
like
sale
,
purchase
and
returns
was
never
easy
before
.

how
long
does
it
take
to
train
new
people
at
work
?

billing
takes
15
minutes
and
back
office
jobs
takes
1
day
's
training
how
fast
your
support
queries
get
answered
?

over
telephone
,
immediate
.

on
call
,
it
takes
a
day
to
get
our
issues
resolved
.

ca
n't
wait
to
go
back
!!!

this
is
by
far
the
best
b&b
that
we
have
ever
stayed
at
!

we
were
in
santa
fe
for
a
special
event
and
our
hosts
rented
out
the
el
paradero
for
all
their
guests
to
stay
at
.

we
could
not
have
been
more
welcomed
,
more
comfortable
or
more
well
fed
.

the
weekend
was
perfect
in
every
way
,
in
large
part
to
sue
and
her
great
staff
.

everyone
was
so
friendly
and
really
went
out
of
their
way
to
make
sure
everything
went
well
.

we
can
not
wait
to
go
back
to
santa
fe
and
to
this
great
b&b
...
especially
my
4
year
old
,
who
made
friends
with
ms.
sue
and
all
the
ladies
,
and
has
talked
about
them
since
we
left
!

we
would
highly
recommend
the
el
paradero
on
your
next
trip
to
santa
fe
!

disatisfied
customer
,
i
went
through
kitchen
aid
and
used
one
of
their
recommended
vendors
.

a&e
came
out
,
charged
$
129
fee
just
to
walk
in
the
door
.

i
needed
a
part
for
my
appliance
,
the
cost
was
very
high
so
i
said
never
mind
,
paid
the
fee
and
called
a
local
business
for
a
second
quote
.

the
second
vendor
charged
$
55
(
less
than
half
of
what
a&e
charges
)
to
come
and
applied
that
to
the
price
of
the
repair
service
(
which
a&e
does
not
)
.

their
quote
came
in
at
half
the
price
of
a&e
for
the
same
work
and
same
part
.

seems
to
me
like
a&e
charges
way
more
than
necessary
!

very
disappointed
in
kitchen
aid
as
well
,
i
thought
that
they
pre-screened
their
vendors
for
price
and
quality
of
work
,
obviously
they
do
not
!

lovely
nails
on
cayuga
st.
in
lewiston
,
ny

first
let
me
start
out
by
saying
,
that
i
have
had
very
nice
pedicures
at
lovely
nails
on
military
road
.

i
was
very
excited
that
a
salon
was
opening
in
lewiston
,
as
i
live
in
youngstown
.

i
was
in
two
weeks
ago
and
had
the
worst
pedicure
that
i
have
had
in
my
life
.

there
were
four
of
us
and
i
was
taken
first
by
a
gentleman
.

i
put
my
foot
in
the
water
and
it
was
cool
.

he
did
warm
it
up
.

he
also
hurt
my
toes
will
pushing
my
cuticles
back
.

if
the
pedicure
lasted
20
mins.
,
that
was
a
stretch
.

the
other
ladies
had
a
similar
experience
,
both
had
nail
polish
on
a
couple
of
toes
.

none
of
us
will
be
using
their
services
again
,
which
is
a
shame
.

good
service
-
limited
results

andrew
was
helpful
and
knowledgeable
about
acupuncture
re
:
infertility
.

he
was
willing
to
talk
to
me
about
my
specific
issues
and
develop
a
plan
of
action
.

the
office
is
shared
with
a
foot
doctor
and
it
's
very
sterile
and
medical
feeling
,
which
i
liked
.

the
down
side
was
that
sometimes
there
was
a
lot
of
noise
in
the
hallway
from
other
patients
/
doctors
.

i
worked
with
andrew
for
2
months
and
did
acupuncture
and
herbs
.

the
sessions
were
nice
and
i
felt
relaxed
after
them
but
did
not
notice
any
changes
with
my
cycles
.

i
know
it
can
take
a
while
for
results
and
did
n't
expect
a
miracle
,
but
after
2
months
i
felt
like
it
was
not
entirely
worth
the
cost
/
time
.

(
i
am
also
a
little
suspicious
of
all
these
glowing
reviews
...
)

friendly
,
clean
and
excellent
location

the
staff
was
very
helpful
,
and
gave
us
good
advice
on
day
and
night
time
activities
.

common
room
was
comfortable
and
clean
,
very
good
room
to
read
or
relax
.
-

a
great
breakfast
which
was
included
every
morning
until
9:30
am
;
yummy
fresh
parisian
croissants
.

comfortable
and
clean
beds
,
a
bit
noisy
when
people
were
coming
in
late
from
a
night
out
,
but
we
did
n't
mind
too
much
as
we
were
also
just
coming
in
from
a
night
out
!

the
location
is
really
stellar
!

it
is
next
to
gare
du
nord
and
a
five
minute
walk
to
sacre
coeur
which
is
excellent
for
shopping
.

it
is
close
to
bus
lines
for
opera
plaza
,
galleries
lafayette
,
and
the
famous
flea
market
.

we
really
enjoyed
our
stay
and
would
definitely
stay
at
the
vintage
hostel
again
.

just
autos
thank
you
!

was
fast
and
easy
,
just
had
our
car
returned
this
morning
,
i
would
recommend
these
mobile
mechanics
for
sure
.

they
certainly
know
what
they
are
doing
.

the
mechanic
came
to
our
place
and
sorted
out
our
car
s
problems
,
he
explained
the
problem
and
was
very
up
front
and
honest
,
it
was
towed
to
the
workshop
as
the
gearbox
was
not
working
(
he
explained
it
better
)
.

they
phoned
the
same
day
,
confirmed
it
was
the
gearbox
quoted
me
the
job
,
i
gave
the
go
ahead
.

now
my
car
s
gears
and
brakes
have
never
run
so
well
...
ever
it
s
like
driving
a
new
car
.

so
yes
,
i
would
n't
hesitate
in
recommending
the
team
at
just
autos
for
easy
professional
car
repairs
,
thank
you
just
autos
for
your
help
.

i
stopped
in
today
@
yards
brewery
.

i
must
say
,
i
was
impressed
with
the
size
of
the
bar
area
and
lounge
,
&
i
liked
that
you
could
see
the
brewery
right
thru
the
glass
!

i
had
a
sampler
of
ipa
,
brawler
,
love
stout
&
esa
.

all
were
awesome
,
&
i
had
a
dogwood
grilled
cheese
which
was
enjoyable
with
the
fine
beers
.

after
my
sampler
&
sandwich
,
i
asked
for
a
pint
of
there
nitrogen
love
stout
,
i
must
say
i
was
impressed
,
with
the
great
taste
&
i
am
a
guiness
lover
so
coming
from
me
,
i
think
this
is
better
,
it
s
less
dry
&
smoother
!

if
you
are
in
philly
you
have
to
come
check
this
place
out
!

the
only
negative
i
have
abou
this
place
is
the
parking
!

i
left
with
a
case
of
brawler
!!!!

oil
change
disaster

my
wife
had
taken
her
'07
ford
fusion
in
for
a
routine
oil
change
.

a
couple
days
after
the
oil
change
,
the
engine
ran
rough
,
the
low
oil
pressure
light
would
come
on
sporadically
,
and
the
engine
would
whir
loudly
.

turns
out
the
engine
had
no
oil
,
and
when
oil
was
put
it
,
it
would
just
run
out
of
the
filter
.

there
could
have
(
hopefully
does
n't
have
)
major
damage
to
the
engine
.

all
of
this
started
after
their
oil
change
.

once
they
realized
their
mistake
they
sent
a
mechanic
and
tow
truck
to
my
wife
's
work
and
towed
it
back
to
fix
it
.

i
would
not
recommend
this
shop
for
anything
,
not
even
something
as
simple
as
an
oil
change
.

plus
they
will
overcharge
you
for
just
about
everything
,
and
smile
while
doing
it
.

liars
,
negative
stars
!

took
my
cruze
in
twice
for
poor
fuel
economy
.

the
first
time
they
claimed
to
get
reasonable
mpg
.

however
,
they
would
never
drive
the
car
with
me
in
it
to
prove
their
findings
.

i
wonder
if
they
were
going
down
a
hill
!

they
told
me
to
bring
it
back
after
5000
miles
.

i
brought
it
back
with
9000
miles
.

they
"
finished
"
the
work
and
told
me
the
car
was
ready
.

i
found
out
they
did
not
even
drive
the
car
,
stated
they
looked
at
it
before
.

they
still
would
not
drive
the
car
with
me
to
show
their
mpg
number
.

they
also
claimed
not
to
see
anything
wrong
with
the
blower
fan
(
a
seperate
issue
)
,
but
when
i
drove
the
car
home
i
had
the
same
symptoms
.

i
will
never
purchace
another
vehicle
from
vic
canever
.

great
job

i
want
to
say
that
mike
did
a
great
job
for
our
family
in
our
time
of
need
.

both
my
grandparents
passed
away
4
months
apart
and
mike
was
very
understanding
.

it
was
a
very
trying
time
for
my
family
and
myself
yet
mike
took
the
time
to
greet
each
and
every
one
one
of
us
.

he
is
very
professional
in
his
position
as
a
director
and
yet
he
still
made
time
to
be
compassionate
for
what
we
were
all
going
through
.

i
'm
sure
it
s
not
every
day
that
a
funeral
director
sees
the
same
family
in
such
a
short
time
.

my
grandfather
passed
away
silently
in
his
sleep
,
and
my
grandmother
passed
away
after
a
short
struggle
with
cancer
.

both
my
grandparents
looked
as
natural
as
could
be
expected
.

thank
you
mike
for
all
your
help
professionally
and
personally

poor
service

if
you
like
the
drama
described
in
popular
sitcom
'
seinfeld
'
,
you
will
see
it
here
.

we
signed
our
name
in
about
6:00
pm
.

there
were
3
names
before
us
.

the
greeter
said
there
was
about
15
minutes
waiting
.

however
,
we
waited
and
waited
and
in
the
mean
time
,
saw
4
groups
of
people
simply
just
paraded
in
without
signing
there
names
.

this
sign
in
policy
is
posted
by
the
restaurant
"
no
reservation
,
sign
your
name
here
"
.

i
had
to
ask
the
greeter
,
he
explained
his
reasons
with
broken
english
.

i
could
not
understand
any
his
reasons
.

i
could
only
take
it
as
they
would
seat
the
people
they
know
first
.

my
conclusion
is
that
you
should
only
go
there
if
you
want
to
wait
a
least
an
hour
and
see
all
kinds
other
people
being
seated
before
you
.

instructor
never
showed
up
!

january
15th
--
we
were
signed
up
for
saturday
's
2
pm
class
"
beginning
yoga
with
brittany
.
"

we
even
arrived
10
minutes
early
as
the
website
suggests
.

the
instructor
did
not
show
up
!

we
waited
until
2:25
pm
and
then
left
.

there
were
2
in
our
group
,
and
a
3rd
person
was
also
in
the
parking
lot
waiting
for
this
class
.

well
,
not
much
i
can
say
except
i
'm
very
disappointed
with
this
experience
.

this
was
our
first
visit
to
your
studio
.

in
today
's
instant
world
,
there
's
no
reason
for
the
instructor
not
to
even
have
given
us
a
phone
call
or
e-mail
if
she
was
going
to
be
late
.

as
a
yoga
studio
,
i
'm
sure
you
're
all
aware
that
all
actions
generate
karma
.

and
sometimes
karma
can
manifest
itself
on
a
bad
review
on
google
.

finest
??

really
??

i
beg
to
differ
.

this
place
is
marginal
at
best
.

not
very
welcoming
and
focused
mostly
on
keeping
little
kids
entertained
.

i
was
not
impressed
,
and
quite
frustrated
at
their
lack
of
rating
for
their
courses
.

i
understand
not
wanting
to
put
labels
like
5.10
on
an
indoor
course
,
because
yes
,
it
is
not
the
same
,
but
some
clear
understanding
of
the
difficulty
of
one
course
to
another
is
nice
when
you
are
an
intermediate
climber
looking
to
improve
.

i
do
n't
want
to
waste
my
time
on
routes
set
for
children
,
but
i
do
n't
want
to
take
on
something
i
ca
n't
handle
just
to
strain
myself
to
exhaustion
.

rate
the
routes
,
with
understandable
markings
and
a
more
detailed
system
than
easy
,
moderate
,
and
hard
.

again
,
a
great
outing
for
the
kids
,
a
frustration
for
an
out
of
town
climber
.

best
dj's
in
town
!

wow
!

these
guys
were
the
best
.

they
were
thorough
,
high
class
,
and
went
above
and
beyond
.

we
never
had
to
worry
about
a
thing
,
and
they
led
the
way
the
whole
time
.

they
asked
us
things
that
we
would
have
never
have
thought
of
,
and
took
extra
time
to
meet
with
us
when
we
needed
it
before
the
wedding
.

having
a
team
was
the
best
because
they
kept
the
flow
of
the
wedding
going
the
whole
time
!

they
may
look
young
but
do
n't
let
that
fool
you
,
as
their
knowledge
of
music
far
surpassed
what
we
expected
.

i
am
a
music
junkie
that
grew
up
in
the
80's
,
and
my
dad
worked
for
a
record
label
in
the
1960's
.

so
we
did
n't
expect
them
to
even
know
some
of
the
requests
that
we
asked
that
night
.

they
just
really
know
their
stuff
!

never
fear
going
to
the
dentist
again
!

i
'm
61
years
old
and
have
dental
problems
my
entire
life
.

by
the
age
of
24
i
stopped
going
to
the
dentist
.

my
fear
and
discomfort
from
dental
work
scared
me
!

it
took
all
the
courage
i
could
muster
to
make
an
appointment
.

at
the
front
door
of
his
office
,
i
nearly
turned
around
.

i
considered
just
leaving
after
going
inside
and
nearly
did
.

doctor
gonzales
and
his
entire
staff
are
the
most
professional
people
i
have
ever
dealt
with
.

they
made
me
feel
confident
in
what
they
would
do
,
and
treated
me
like
a
member
of
their
own
family
.

i
never
felt
pain
or
discomfort
.

the
ability
to
smile
and
eat
again
can
only
be
described
as
a
whole
new
lease
on
life
.

thank
you
doctor
gonzales
,
doctor
stout
,
eva
marie
and
the
entire
staff

horrible
service
and
food

not
only
is
this
place
too
expensive
for
what
it
is
,
it
s
horrible
!

in
the
past
,
i
got
a
steak
and
there
was
more
fat
and
rough
pieces
than
there
was
good
steak
(
and
this
was
the
sirloin
!
)
,
the
sides
were
drenched
with
butter
and
the
salad
was
a
little
on
the
brown
side
.

today
we
went
for
a
party
(
during
lunch
,
so
the
place
was
empty
)
with
about
25
other
people
.

it
took
over
1.5
hours
for
our
food
to
come
out
and
by
that
time
my
8
month
old
had
it
!

does
it
seriously
take
that
long
for
a
soup
and
salad
?

i
was
a
waitress
for
years
and
a
key
rule
is
to
serve
customers
with
small
children
before
others
,
as
i
was
the
last
to
get
my
food
.

i
would
not
recommend
having
a
party
here
or
even
going
here
.

texas
roadhouse
is
way
better
!!

spay
and
neuter
service
.

i
have
no
doubt
that
the
rescue
is
wonderful
.

but
i
had
my
cat
spayed
through
their
reduced
/
free
spay
and
neuter
program
and
the
vet
they
sent
us
to
was
first
of
all
a
hour
and
a
half
away
,
and
4
days
later
we
had
to
bring
them
to
our
normal
vet
because
the
vets
at
the
place
in
wisconsin
did
a
crappy
job
and
they
got
infections
.

my
vet
even
said
it
was
not
my
fault
it
was
the
vet
that
did
the
surgery
,
so
i
would
not
recommend
getting
that
program
unless
you
have
an
extra
hundred
dollars
or
so
for
antibiotics
and
a
vet
visit
.

you
'd
think
they
would
do
a
good
job
but
they
do
n't
care
unless
they
are
getting
paid
full
price
.

which
is
so
dumb
.

not
to
mention
the
fact
that
they
gave
us
our
cats
back
not
even
30
minutes
after
they
were
out
from
surgery
.

billing
issues
...

i
had
a
routine
surgery
for
an
ingrown
toenail
.

my
insurance
company
,
blue
cross
/
blue
shield
paid
the
fees
and
everything
was
fine
.

then
i
got
a
bill
for
$
483.00
.

the
doctor
's
office
said
that
payments
had
been
"
reversed
"
.

blue
cross
has
no
record
of
aa
reversal
.

the
office
refused
my
requests
to
see
what
they
got
from
bc
/
bs
.

they
eventually
turned
it
over
to
a
collection
agency
and
now
will
not
even
discuss
the
matter
.

i
eventually
decided
to
just
pay
the
balance
even
though
the
doctor
has
already
been
paid
,
but
now
the
collection
agency
is
trying
to
say
another
reversal
of
$
160.00
has
come
through
.

it
was
an
ingrown
toenail
.

how
much
could
it
possibly
cost
?

not
only
am
i
being
bilked
for
money
i
do
not
owe
,
the
office
staff
is
rude
to
boot
.

i
think
this
office
has
some
serious
billing
practice
issues
!

we
have
been
blessed
to
find
elite
flyers
online
and
would
not
use
anyone
else
to
handle
our
postcards
,
posters
,
etc
.

we
were
looking
for
a
company
with
decent
rates
as
our
company
was
just
getting
started
.

they
have
the
best
rates
and
great
customer
service
.

on
one
order
,
we
needed
it
rushed
and
shipped
to
a
different
state
.

they
did
that
with
no
problem
.

i
also
appreciate
their
honesty
.

i
sent
a
graphic
that
would
have
been
distorted
if
printed
as
it
was
.

they
called
and
worked
with
me
to
fix
it
so
that
it
would
look
perfect
.

they
recently
surprised
me
a
larger
order
.

i
ordered
1000
postcards
,
we
normally
order
5000
or
more
.

because
they
had
room
to
do
5000
,
they
created
the
larger
amount
,
and
shipped
them
early
.

i
recommend
this
company
to
anyone
and
everyone
that
needs
great
work
done
at
a
reasonable
rate
!

they
have
a
customer
for
life
in
us
!

sheisters

i
made
the
mistake
of
buying
from
these
thieves
.

i
paid
2
k
cash
for
a
truck
with
a
blown
motor
.

their
so
called
mechanic
said
the
engine
was
good
and
"
there
is
nothing
mechanicly
wrong
with
this
truck
"
.

well
i
think
a
blown
engine
falls
under
the
catagory
of
mechanics
right
?

anyway
they
jimmy
rigged
it
so
i
could
drive
it
home
.

the
next
day
i
took
it
to
2
auto
shops
and
they
both
told
me
the
same
thing
,
engine
is
junk
.

i
called
and
got
the
same
runaround
on
hold
and
noone
calls
you
back
.

from
a
moral
standpoint
,
you
guys
are
really
gon
na
take
2,000
bucks
from
someone
that
needs
that
truck
to
work
and
support
his
family
when
you
know
it
s
just
a
piece
of
scrap
metal
?

if
it
lasted
1
month
i
could
suck
it
up
but
1
day
?

grimy
work
you
guys
do
.

your
kids

papeluna
,
a

custom

store
,
just
opened
a
few
days
ago
.

it
is
right
on
the

of

but
some
might
miss
it
as
it
is
nestled
in

i
popped
in
after
my
afternoon
pumpkin

at

it
's
an
adorable
little
store
filled
with
lots
of

i

a

card
to
let

watch
out
for
your
wallet
!

this
company
is
overpriced
for
their
services
.

they
pride
themselves
on
being
an
event
and
team
building
company
for
corporate
clients
but
you
better
believe
they
are
going
to
mark
you
up
on
that
feel
good
premise
.

on
a
recent
event
quote
that
i
had
done
,
they
came
in
thousands
of
dollars
over
their
local
competition
.

the
craziest
part
is
that
they
are
n't
even
based
locally
at
the
city
i
'm
in
-
they
just
have
'
teams
'
in
areas
through
the
country
.

i
've
spoken
to
vendors
who
are
used
by
them
who
had
nothing
good
to
say
about
the
company
as
well
and
in
fact
were
afraid
to
quote
events
against
them
even
though
they
openly
admitted
that
they
felt
canadian
outback
was
pricing
their
entertainment
out
of
the
market
and
doing
more
to
hurt
their
business
than
help
them
.

be
warned
-
they
'll
ltake
you
for
everything
they
can
.

believe
me
.

orr
's
a
nightmare
!

do
n't
go
!

my
boyfriend
and
i
were
woken
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
at
our
campsite
by
drunken
kids
who
'd
arrived
around
1:00
am
and
were
drinking
at
the
springs
.

when
we
complained
to
the
management
(
as
we
were
instructed
to
do
if
there
were
any
problems
)
,
nothing
happened
!

then
,
the
next
morning
,
when
we
,
among
many
other
irate
guests
,
asked
to
speak
to
the
owner
,
he
refused
to
do
so
.

not
only
that
,
but
he
told
us
,
via
his
manager
,
that
it
was
our
responsibility
to
get
up
a
second
time
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
call
the
night
staff
if
the
problem
continued
,
even
though
his
manager
did
nothing
the
first
time
to
stop
the
kids
.

orr
is
not
relaxing
,
it
's
not
a
safe
space
,
and
the
owner
is
awful
.

to
add
insult
to
injury
,
he
refused
to
refund
our
money
.

do
n't
go
!

fhs
is
a
good
high
school
--
c
/
o
1998

i
enjoyed
my
time
at
franklin
high
school
.

we
had
relatively
good
facilities
at
the
time
--
decent
science
labs
,
with
multiple
hoods
and
access
to
good
equipment
;
nice
gymnasiums
,
and
a
well
-
funded
music
department
(
i
was
in
the
guitar
ensemble
)
.

now
,
of
course
,
there
's
a
new
building
,
with
presumably
better
facilities
.

all
to
the
good
.

for
those
who
care
,
a
good
proportion
of
the
my
class
went
on
to
4
-
year
colleges
,
many
of
them
ranked
in
the
top
50
of
us
news
.

if
i
remember
,
students
went
to
dartmouth
,
u.
penn
,
duke
,
bu
,
william
and
mary
,
vassar
,
howard
,
and
carnegie
mellon
,
among
others
.

many
students
went
to
rutgers
,
including
their
top
-
ranked
pharmacy
program
.

the
point
is
--
fhs
gives
you
the
opportunity
to
make
it
to
a
good
college
,
but
you
need
to
work
hard
.

absolutely
the
best
little
motel
on
the
coast
!

i
've
stayed
at
this
fabulous
little
motel
two
years
running
,
and
i
have
to
say
it
's
one
of
the
best
lodging
experiences
i
've
ever
had
on
the
coast
...
and
i
'm
even
comparing
it
to
the
big
resorts
i
've
stayed
at
!

a
large
group
of
my
friends
and
i
rent
almost
the
whole
motel
every
year
for
a
weekend
,
and
the
experience
and
stay
have
always
been
five
-
star
.

the
rooms
are
so
clean
,
the
managers
/
owners
are
the
nicest
people
,
the
place
feels
so
homey
,
and
the
location
and
grounds
are
beautiful
.

there
's
a
restaurant
nearby
(
walking
distance
)
with
a
great
breakfast
,
and
a
market
across
the
street
.

the
motel
is
very
well
maintained
,
and
the
managers
are
so
accomodating
,
it
's
kind
of
like
visiting
family
each
year
!
;-)

i
honestly
ca
n't
rave
enough
about
this
place
...
it
's
really
a
hidden
gem
worth
checking
out
!

my
favorite
cuban
cafe
in
orlando

i
have
been
eating
cuban
for
a
long
time
,
sandwiches
mainly
along
with
other
dishes
..

i
love
cuban
coffee
,
colada
...
mmmm
anyways
i
found
this
place
and
ca
n't
stop
going
there
,
i
stop
in
at
least
once
a
week
and
anytime
i
'm
in
the
area
for
a
cuban
coffee
or
snack
.

the
place
is
chill
and
comfortable
.

they
do
n't
speak
the
best
english
but
enough
to
get
by
.

they
bake
bread
fresh
daily
,
they
do
n't
press
their
sandwiches
which
is
the
way
i
like
it
,
and
the
meat
is
always
fresh
.

they
have
a
great
lunch
special
with
your
choice
of
meat
,
chicken
,
steak
,
or
pork
and
rice
and
black
beans
and
fried
plantains
.

and
their
breakfast
is
awesome
!!

i
can
not
describe
how
delicious
the
mango
and
cheese
pastries
and
the
omelets
are
to
die
for
.

stop
in
and
have
a
bite
you
wo
n't
regret
it
.

a
slice
of
heaven
in
winter
park
off
forsyth
!

highly
recommended
.

i
have
been
going
to
warner
family
for
a
number
of
years
and
would
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
.

i
've
read
some
of
the
reviews
below
and
would
like
to
state
that
yes
,
like
any
other
doctor
s
office
there
is
sometimes
a
wait
(
depending
on
what
other
patients
are
being
seen
for
)
and
some
of
the
tests
and
procedures
that
are
ran
can
be
costly
(
just
like
they
would
be
for
any
other
medical
tests
elsewhere
if
you
do
not
have
insurance
)
...

i
have
seen
several
of
the
providers
from
the
office
and
have
not
once
been
shown
anything
but
care
and
consideration
.

i
ca
nt
speak
for
them
but
any
tests
or
appointments
they
recommend
are
probably
in
the
best
interests
of
us
(
the
patient
)
and
you
have
the
ability
to
decline
anything
that
they
suggest
to
you
.

i
personally
have
had
wonderful
service
and
if
you
re
truely
looking
for
a
family
practice
...
warner
family
is
the
place
for
you
.

not
what
i
expected
!

we
read
the
good
reviews
before
going
and
had
high
hopes
..
but
to
our
dismay
it
did
nt
turn
out
that
way
!

~
it
took
over
40
mins
to
be
taken
to
our
table
,
once
there
it
took
another
20
mins
to
get
our
orders
and
a
further
45
mins
till
our
starters
landed
on
our
table
.

very
frustrating
for
a
restaurant
that
has
1
rosette
and
is
supposedly
renowned
for
the
service
...
hmm
there
was
no
canape's
or
amuse
to
keep
us
occupied
,
once
we
complained
about
the
wait
they
took
us
something
to
nibble
on
but
that
took
us
getting
out
our
chairs
and
wondering
round
to
do
that
and
it
was
impossible
to
get
anyone
s
attention
.

scallops
were
overcooked
and
the
foie
gras
was
cold
but
the
rest
of
the
food
was
lovely
.

on
top
of
that
though
they
tried
to
charge
us
service
charge
just
to
rub
it
it
....

would
n't
go
back
as
there
are
a
lot
of
places
a
lot
better
and
cheaper
.

nice
selection
,
very
clean
,
friendly
staff
!

hot
iron
has
become
a
favorite
of
our
family
.

everyone
can
get
the
signature
dish
with
ingredients
and
spices
that
they
want
and
have
the
fun
of
watching
it
cook
.

the
staff
are
very
friendly
and
conscientious
.

they
always
ask
if
you
have
meat
in
your
dish
,
(
for
vegetarians
like
me
)
,
they
scrub
an
area
of
the
grill
and
use
separate
utensils
to
cook
.

they
do
n't
just
dump
your
ingredients
on
and
cook
either
,
but
carefully
separate
meat
to
the
hotter
parts
of
the
grill
and
still
manage
to
keep
the
veggies
from
turning
to
mush
.

the
selection
of
meats
,
veggies
and
sauces
is
awesome
too
!

every
time
we
go
they
seem
to
have
a
different
ingredient
or
two
which
keeps
things
interesting
.

meats
are
kept
very
cold
,
seafood
smells
fresh
and
the
serving
bar
is
very
clean
.

prices
are
reasonable
,
(
kid
s
meals
are
around
4.99
)
and
wednesday's
they
have
discount
dinner
prices
,
i
believe
.

great
cookies
,
cakes
,
and
customer
service

it
was
my
birthday
and
i
had
a
last
minute
idea
to
have
a
bakery
cake
instead
of
one
pre-made
in
a
convenience
store
,
but
the
problem
was
it
was
the
day
before
valentine
s
and
when
many
bakeries
turned
me
down
for
a
plain
vanilla
rectangle
cake
,
fiona
stepped
up
to
the
plate
and
was
able
to
make
a
fantastic
beautiful
cake
.

not
only
did
it
taste
wonderful
,
but
the
texture
was
unbelievable
,
the
frosting
was
n't
overly
sweet
to
over
power
the
cake
,
and
the
cake
itself
was
just
amazingly
soft
,
and
fluffy
,
and
just
perfect
overall
.

although
i
'll
have
to
drive
a
little
out
of
my
way
to
go
there
,
i
'll
gladly
do
it
knowing
that
since
she
's
been
astounding
to
me
once
before
that
she
'll
always
be
that
way
!

(
also
she
has
a
really
great
website
!

and
we
bought
a
few
cookies
there
too
,
they
were
fantastic
as
well
!
)

she
deserves
many
5
star
reviews
!!

food
craving
gone
and
weight
loss
at
acupuncture
doctor

i
am
a
college
student
.

before
treatment
,
my
food
cravings
were
"
out
of
control
"
which
caused
me
to
be
stressed
out
.

i
experienced
a
definite
decrease
in
food
craving
(
about
50
%
)
and
decrease
in
stress
after
the
1st
treatment
.

i
actually
loss
4
pounds
after
my
1st
treatment
and
2
pounds
after
my
2nd
treatment
.

i
was
amazed
.

i
am
now
more
at
peace
and
my
food
craving
is
about
99
%
gone
after
only
3
treatments
.

before
coming
to
acupuncture
doctor
i
was
a
big
baby
about
needles
and
only
came
because
my
boyfriend
's
aunt
recommended
it
.

it
hurt
very
little
,
felt
more
like
pressure
than
pain
.

what
i
like
most
about
dr.
liau
is
that
she
is
very
caring
.

she
talks
to
you
at
each
appointment
.

i
can
tell
she
really
cares
and
wants
to
help
.

i
am
so
glad
to
have
found
dr.
liau
.

now
i
feel
more
confident
wearing
my
bathing
suit
in
the
summer
.

an
asset
to
richmond

for
a
long
time
,
one
big
source
of
entertainment
missing
from
the
richmond
city
limits
was
a
first
-
run
multiplex
.

bowtie
has
filled
that
role
nicely
.

the
theatre
is
in
an
old
brick
warehouse
,
which
is
a
block
away
from
the
flying
squirrels
stadium
.

the
owners
of
bowtie
manged
to
add
something
new
while
preserving
what
was
already
there
.

the
theatre
has
greatly
improved
the
surrounding
neighborhood
.

there
's
plenty
of
parking
,
and
i
've
never
had
an
issue
with
audience
members
who
wo
n't
stop
talking
or
answering
their
cellphones
.

best
of
all
,
there
are
no
ads
!!!!
!

just
previews
and
the
main
feature
.

expect
to
pay
full
price
,
and
the
theatres
themselves
are
on
the
small
side
.

but
if
you
like
going
to
the
movies
,
you
should
love
bowtie
.

the
mangers
also
play
a
classic
movies
on
sundays
,
you
can
get
a
beer
in
the
lobby
,
and
repeat
customers
can
get
discounts
if
they
have
a
member
card
.

a
great
cinema
in
a
great
location
.

thank
you
,
bowtie
!

craft
wonderland
with
history

my
first
visit
was
so
fun
yesterday
.

i
could
have
stayed
all
day
and
not
seen
all
the
things
.

i
am
doing
origami
jewelry
and
found
exactly
the
right
things
for
earrings
and
got
many
other
ideas
there
too
.

i
bought
a
beginner
s
quilling
set
and
like
making
the
filigree
forms
you
can
make
and
add
to
other
crafts
.

the
owner
,
jean
,
has
been
there
31
years
!

what
a
history
.

she
is
a
super
sweet
,
lovable
and
well
-
informed
woman
with
a
great
sense
of
humor
.

i
really
enjoyed
meeting
her
and
happy
to
learn
she
comes
from
oklahoma
and
has
the
values
of
a
solid
no
bs
country
girl
.

this
store
is
a
real
gem
and
has
much
to
offer
the
serious
crafter
or
the
occasional
crafter
.

by
the
way
,
salmagundi
(
the
store
name
)
means
something
like
smorgasbord
;
potpourri
;
motley
;
variety
;
mixed
bag
;
miscellaneous
assortment
;
mixture
,
a
variety
of
many
kinds
of
things
.

great
name
for
a
great
store
!

the
2010
genesis
is
grrrrrrrreeeaaat
!

i
am
a
proud
owner
of
a
brand
new
2010
hyundai
genesis
.

i
have
never
seen
this
car
before
until
this
lady
at
wal
mart
had
it
and
she
told
me
she
got
it
here
and
that
everyone
was
so
nice
to
her
.

i
asked
her
who
she
worked
with
and
she
just
told
me
ti
was
the
sales
manager
.

i
took
the
weekend
off
and
came
in
and
asked
for
the
manager
who
is
jeff
and
he
remembered
her
right
away
even
remembered
her
dog
,
i
was
a
bit
shocked
that
someone
would
pay
that
close
attention
.

we
got
to
talking
and
he
got
me
set
up
and
i
test
drove
with
craig
and
i
fell
head
over
heels
for
this
car
all
i
kept
saying
,
"
was
i
got
ta
have
it
!
"

i
thouhgt
it
would
be
out
of
my
price
range
but
they
really
worked
with
me
and
now
i
could
nt
be
happier
.

jeff
and
craig
are
really
good
at
what
they
do
and
know
exactly
how
to
treat
a
customer
.

definitely
go
see
them
!

bait
and
switch
,
untrained
workers

called
the
bonanza
store
2
weeks
ago
,
before
i
ripped
out
350
sq
ft
of
ceramic
tile
...
was
told
i
would
need
a
"
dual
head
concrete
grinder
"
to
remove
thinset
and
make
a
nice
"
finished
"
look
(
ready
for
concrete
stain
)
.

was
quoted
$
55
all
inclusive
of
grinder
inserts
,
etc
.

no
problem
,
sounded
like
it
's
done
every
day
.

will
look
beautiful
.

got
the
tile
ripped
out
,
call
today
,
now
all
the
sudden
this
grinder
wo
n't
leave
a
finished
look
and
it
's
$
125
plus
around
$
75
for
the
inserts
.

i
can
rent
another
machine
for
like
$
60
that
will
give
it
a
finished
look
.

so
from
$
55
to
$
260
?

are
they
serious
?

i
feel
like
they
did
n't
tell
me
the
pitfalls
before
i
pulled
out
this
tile
and
now
that
i
have
no
other
options
they
want
5
times
the
price
?

either
these
people
do
n't
know
anything
about
what
they
are
renting
,
or
worse
-
they
are
bait
and
switching
.

one
suspects
that
earlier
reviewer
works
for
another
laundry
.

outside
of
parking
being
at
a
premium
,
especially
on
discount
days
,
the
laundry
tub
is
not
filthy
and
it
's
no
smaller
than
any
of
a
dozen
laundromats
i
've
been
in
.

yes
,
there
are
bigger
,
but
bigger
is
n't
necessarily
better
.

i
availed
myself
of
the
wash
'n
fold
service
,
taking
just
about
a
year
's
worth
of
dirty
clothes
in
and
getting
back
neatly
folded
,
clean
clothes
in
clear
plastic
bags
(
i
'd
originally
brought
them
in
,
in
six
large
yellow
garbage
bags
)
.

the
cost
was
certainly
reasonable
and
i
will
continue
my
patronage
of
the
laundry
tub
in
the
future
.

did
n't
hurt
any
that
they
knew
my
name
by
my
second
visit
and
greeted
me
warmly
then
and
on
my
third
visit
.

whereas
my
answer
to
the
question
"
where
do
you
get
your
laundry
done
?
"
used
to
be
,
"
at
the
checkout
line
at
walmart
,
"
i
can
honestly
say
the
answer
now
is
,
"
at
the
laundry
tub
.
"

thank
you
!

i
recently
took
a
rescue
puppy
to
this
clinic
and
i
was
shocked
at
how
well
romeo
and
my
family
was
treated
.

they
worked
around
the
clock
to
ensure
that
my
puppy
life
was
saved
.

we
have
to
leave
him
at
the
vet
for
3
days
and
i
was
told
to
call
for
check
ups
as
often
as
i
wished
that
no
matter
how
many
times
i
called
i
would
not
annoy
them
.

lol
they
where
super
friendly
towards
us
and
treated
us
like
people
not
walking
bags
of
cash
.

in
this
day
it
s
rare
to
find
such
wonderful
people
who
care
,
not
the
kind
of
want
to
make
cash
.

i
would
strongly
suggest
you
give
them
the
chance
to
prove
to
you
that
not
all
people
in
this
world
are
evil
!

i
will
never
go
to
another
vet
as
long
as
i
have
animals
.

i
live
nearly
two
hours
away
and
yet
i
will
still
make
the
drive
to
see
them
!

in
fact
i
look
forward
to
taking
my
animals
to
the
vet
simply
because
of
how
my
animals
and
i
are
treated
.

okay
,
here
's
the
scoop
.

i
'm
a
regular
at
the
hh
.

the
food
is
excellent
,
the
serivce
is
horrible
.

i
think
they
're
still
in
the
mindset
from
when
it
was
only
smokers
sitting
around
and
drinking
...
not
in
any
hurry
.

in
my
experience
the
food
has
been
excellent
(
for
the
most
part
)
.

however
,
the
bartenders
/
waitresses
definately
need
to
be
re-trained
(
if
they
ever
had
any
to
begin
with
)
and
learn
two
things
:
only
chat
with
customers
when
other
customers
are
not
impatiently
waiting
and
to
look
around
more
often
to
see
if
people
are
waiting
.

in
some
cases
the
result
is
because
of
understaffing
,
in
some
cases
the
staff
just
does
n't
care
/
know
better
.

they
must
also
get
something
to
keep
take
-
out
warm
,
so
it
's
not
room
temperature
at
best
when
you
get
it
home
.

you
just
have
to
know
what
you
're
getting
into
when
you
go
.

nice
local
pub
,
excellent
food
(
especially

do
n't
go
if
you
have
a
limited
amount
of
time
.

trust
the
midas
touch

i
personally
trust
this
midas
store
with
all
my
vehicles
,
i
have
been
going
there
for
years
&
would
never
go
anywhere
else
!

the
staff
is
very
personable
&
actually
care
about
the
customers
safety
rather
than
taking
there
money
.

this
is
however
a
very
busy
shop
but
there
are
appointments
available
&
the
staff
up
front
will
surely
make
sure
you
get
back
in
a
timely
manner
.

i
look
at
some
of
these
other
comments
&
laugh
because
people
think
that
the
world
revolves
around
them
!

like
the
girl
with
the
fuse
problem
...

midas
has
the
most
high
tech
equipment
in
town
&
i
guarantee
you
if
they
told
you
it
was
electrical
then
in
deed
it
s
electrical
!

maybe
you
should
understand
how
the
world
works
&
realize
you
are
just
like
any
other
person
&
not
put
yourself
on
a
pedestal
.

i
will
continue
going
to
dave
at
midas
because
he
is
one
of
the
most
honest
business
owners
in
this
town
!

when
having
your
car
worked
on
you
have
to
trust
the
mechanic
&
this
midas
is
truly
someone
you
can
trust
!

we
decided
to
try
this
place
last
night
because
we
noticed
that
it
had
some
interesting
things
on
the
menu
aside
from
the
usual
rolls
--
live
scallop
sashimi
,
duck
breast
nigiri
with
foie
gras
,
panko
mussels
--
but
none
of
these
were
particularly
great
or
worth
the
sticker
price
.

additionally
we
tried
the
logan
circle
roll
,
spicy
crab
and
tuna
roll
,
and
sweet
potato
tempura
roll
(
$
15
,
$
10
,
and
$
3.75
respectively
)
.

the
sweet
potato
tempura
roll
was
actually
a
great
surprise
:
cheap
and
delicious
,
the
only
thing
we
tried
that
i
would
say
was
well
worth
it
and
a
great
value
(
and
i
never
get
vegetarian
rolls
)
.

the
other
rolls
were
n't
at
all
special
,
especially
given
their
pricing
.

the
bottom
line
is
that
the
food
is
n't
great
and
is
relatively
high
-
priced
.

the
service
is
solicitous
,
the
atmosphere
is
nice
and
mod
except
the
out
-
of
-
place
flat
-
screen
tv
playing
football
.

but
i
'd
go
elsewhere
unless
the
prices
are
cut
.

it
's
just
not
worth
it
.

do
n't
expect
sleep
or
courtesy

i
was
booked
for
2
nights
at
this
hotel
in
oct
2007
.

at
3:15
am
on
night
2
,
the
fire
alarm
and
strobe
light
activated
in
my
room
.

these
are
not
household
type
alarms
.

when
they
sound
off
,
it
is
a
true
audio
/
visual
experience
.

i
called
the
front
desk
and
got
no
answer
.

after
checking
for
signs
of
fire
or
smoke
and
seeing
none
,
i
decided
to
just
pack
up
and
leave
.

the
desk
agent
actually
argued
with
me
,
claiming
that
no
such
alarm
had
gone
off
(
as
if
i
would
make
that
up
?
)
.

he
finally
admitted
that
only
the
4
ada
room
alarms
had
sounded
,
so
only
4
guests
were
effected
(
no
big
deal
to
him
)
.

this
little
drip
offered
no
apologies
whatsoever
,
and
even
refused
to
give
me
the
name
of
the
manager
until
i
pressed
him
for
it
3
times
.

this
hotel
is
adequate
enough
,
but
there
is
an
obvious
problem
with
the
staff
and
management
.

do
not
go
there
if
you
expect
to
sleep
through
the
night
.

poor
service
,
lack
of
passion
:
do
not
go

i
began
seeing
dr.
romanick
back
in
2000
and
have
seen
a
significant
decline
in
the
quality
of
care
,
patient
-
doctor
communication
,
and
just
the
overall
level
of
services
.

the
poor
quality
starts
at
the
receptionist
desk
,
where
the
staff
is
very
impatient
and
lack
the
efficiency
i
once
loved
about
the
office
.

it
took
them
nearly
two
months
to
complete
a
simple
task
,
and
countless
calls
from
my
part
due
to
their
lack
of
response
and
passion
(
not
that
it
's
a
requirement
for
the
job
,
but
it
helps
to
at
least
pretend
to
be
helpful
)
.

also
,
i
was
promised
to
have
my
test
results
emailed
to
me
,
but
it
never
happened
,
and
after
a
few
attempts
to
get
dr.
romanick
on
the
phone
to
brief
me
on
my
condition
,
i
finally
gave
up
and
went
to
a
different
doctor
.

please
do
not
go
there
if
it
's
professional
,
friendly
,
diligent
medical
services
you
're
looking
for
.

save
yourself
the
trouble
,
money
and
time
and
visit
a
more
caring
facility
/
doctor
.

the
moving
company
is
actualy
based
in
brooklyn
,
but
advertised
all
over
ny
/
nj
,
including
fort
lee
.

when
the
guys
arrived
(
2
hours
later
than
agreed
)
they
told
that
you
have
to
pay
all
the
tolls
they
payed
coming
from
brooklyn
and
extra
$
100
for
them
to
drive
back
from
your
destination
.

that
was
not
in
agreement
eather
,
but
they
realy
demand
it
.

and
another
$
100
for
wrapping
the
furniture
.

so
totalling
$
212
just
for
start
before
any
work
started
.

guess
what
,
was
not
in
the
initial
agreement
as
well
.

i
was
moving
out
from
2
bdr
apartment
and
it
took
for
3
strong
guys
6
hours
to
load
a
track
(
from
2
pm
-
8
pm
)
.

the
only
reason
i
'm
giving
3
stars
instead
of
1
or
2
,
i
should
admit
,
nothing
was
broken
.

so
i
still
can
recomend
them
but
prepare
pay
twice
as
much
as
they
tell
you
initially
.

one
more
thing
,
they
do
n't
take
any
credit
cards
or
checks
.

you
have
to
pay
cash
only
before
they
start
unloading
track
on
your
destination
.

worst
apartments
ever

we
lived
here
for
2
years
,
the
first
year
or
so
was
okay
.

then
,
the
more
power
they
gave
to
linda
,
the
worse
the
place
got
.

we
were
always
having
our
water
shut
off
,
there
were
always
people
having
parties
at
the
pool
,
even
after
it
was
supposed
to
be
closed
.

the
pool
was
supposed
to
close
at
10
and
they
would
have
people
down
there
until
11:45
yelling
,
playing
music
and
do
who
-
knows
-
what
in
the
dark
corners
of
the
pool
.

then
,
when
we
moved
out
,
we
cleaned
the
apartment
top
to
bottom
,
they
came
back
and
tried
to
charge
us
for
two
cleaning
fees
(
and
we
never
got
our
deposit
back
)
and
past
utilities
(
that
were
already
paid
,
we
have
check
numbers
and
records
of
this
)
.

linda
is
the
rudest
person
you
will
ever
talk
to
and
she
sticks
up
for
all
of
the
trashy
,
rude
people
that
live
there
,
not
the
nice
ones
that
actually
give
a
crap
about
respecting
others
.

do
not
live
here
,
you
will
regret
it
!

the
worst
experience
ever
!!!

i
have
worked
with
ted
jurek
at
decor
and
you
,
and
it
started
out
as
a
decent
experience
.

he
was
referred
to
me
by
a
friend
,
who
did
n't
have
the
best
experience
with
ted
,
but
said
that
ted
was
able
to
make
up
for
his
lack
of
preparedness
at
the
end
.

i
figure
i
would
give
this
company
a
chance
.

however
,
after
giving
a
required
$
500.00
(
non
refundable
)
deposit
before
seeing
any
plans
or
ideas
,
i
was
sorry
i
did
.

we
met
a
couple
of
weeks
later
,
ted
was
late
.

he
brought
fabric
books
,
and
pictures
of
furniture
only
,
which
all
came
way
over
budget
.

by
the
time
we
got
to
the
budget
i
told
him
i
could
work
with
,
there
was
basically
no
design
.

just
curtains
and
a
couple
of
accessories
.

what
is
that
?????

this
company
is
way
too
expensive
with
nothing
to
show
for
it
.

please
everyone
....
take
heed
and
do
n't
get
caught
up
in
the
hype
about
decor
and
you
working
with
every
budget
...

this
is
just
a
way
for
them
to
squirm
their
way
into
your
precious
pocket

horrible
.

horrible
.

when
we
walked
in
,
the
person
behind
desk
said
:
"
oh
well
,
you
must
wait
,
i
am
in
the
middle
of
something
.
"

after
a
good
few
minutes
,
he
asked
:
"
what
do
you
want
?
"

somewhere
in
between
his
rudeness
he
asked
if
we
smoked
.

i
asked
if
this
hotel
had
smoking
rooms
.

he
immediately
said
"
no
,
there
is
a
$
50
deposit
now
!
"

sure
enough
he
charged
it
to
the
credit
card
.

when
i
inquired
he
rudely
replied
"
in
the
morning
when
things
are
checked
out
you
'll
get
it
back
.
"

i
called
customer
service
about
it
because
the
website
specifically
states
that
there
are
no
other
charges
at
the
check
-
in
.

i
also
mentioned
to
the
reception
person
.

he
responded
"
we
have
problem
with
'
people
'
"
.

imagine
a
hotel
having
problems
with
people
.

i
finally
alerted
him
to
his
rudeness
.

he
said
he
's
had
a
long
and
bad
day
.

we
had
no
choice
but
to
stay
but
will
take
this
as
far
as
we
can
.

do
n't
stay
there
.

i
came
to
find
out
the
person
was
the
hotel
owner
also
.

my
friend
and
i
were
to
stay
here
for
a
girls
night
,
catch
up
on
our
lives
evening
.

we
live
within
20
miles
of
the
hotel
and
wanted
to
get
away
from
our
responsibilities
for
the
night
.

unfortunalty
my
husband
and
i
had
to
put
our
13
year
old
lab
down
that
morning
and
we
were
not
expecting
this
.

my
friend
called
the
hotel
to
cancel
our
room
as
soon
as
i
called
her
.

they
said
that
we
were
to
be
charged
for
this
room
regardless
because
we
did
not
cancel
within
the
72
hours
.

i
called
them
back
a
few
hours
after
putting
my
bodhi
down
and
they
still
would
n't
budge
.

times
are
hard
,
i
know
,
but
they
had
no
compassion
.

i
called
3
times
to
talked
to
a
manager
,
never
a
call
back
.

i
emailed
4
times
,
never
a
response
.

in
one
of
the
emails
i
attached
the
letter
from
the
vet
's
that
expressed
their
sympathy
,
this
hotel
did
nothing
.

i
even
emailed
mackinaw
tourist
and
nothing
.

i
am
sure
this
is
a
good
place
to
stay
from
reading
the
other
reviews
,
but
if
something
unexpected
happens
in
your
life
,
they
will
not
care
.

fanfuckingtastic

ok
i
am
a
new
yorker
who
has
been
going
to
school
in
oxford
,
england
.

i
thought
the
uk
was
completely
devoid
of
good
nyc
style
pizza
.

i
thought
to
get
a
decent
pizza
the
only
way
was
at
a
fancy
restaurant
,
and
i
have
to
get
a
whole
pie
.

i
thought
i
would
have
to
wait
until
i
went
home
to
nyc
.

well
then
i
went
on
a
trip
to
glasgow
and
was
walking
around
.

i
saw
this
place
and
it
looked
like
the
holy
grail
.

i
knew
i
had
found
the
real
deal
,
big
pies
,
sold
by
the
slice
,
with
the
pizzas
sitting
under
the
glass
in
the
front
.

they
have
crushed
red
pepper
flakes
and
oregano
.

so
i
ordered
a
slice
.

it
tasted
like
i
just
flew
back
home
.

i
du
n
no
how
they
did
it
,
but
scottish
friends
---
this
is
the
real
deal
.

i
congratulated
this
establishment
for
doing
the
research
on
making
nyc
pizza
because
these
scots
fcking
nailed
it
.

that
being
said
,
i
do
n't
know
how
their
delivery
service
is
.

they
might
want
to
change
the
name
to
reflect
the
new
yorkedness
of
the
pizza
,
scrummy
yummy
sounds
gimmicky
to
me
.

good
food
,
good
wait
staff
,
poor
management

we
visited
on
7/26/08
for
dinner
we
received
a
gift
certificate
for
the
mama
mia
's
on
greenfield
ave
.

the
food
was
good
,
and
so
was
our
waitress
.

when
it
came
time
to
pay
the
bill
up
front
,
they
would
not
let
me
use
any
of
the
certificate
for
a
tip
(
which
i
have
done
with
any
other
restaurant
i
've
gotten
a
gift
certificate
for
.
)

i
then
asked
if
i
could
have
money
back
in
cash
.

the
person
went
to
go
check
with
the
manager
,
who
was
sitting
at
a
table
chatting
with
her
friends
who
were
eating
there
.

her
answer
was
short
and
manner
rather
rude
.

sorry
for
interrupting
i
guess
.

the
cashier
was
also
short
,
unapologetic
and
made
me
feel
as
i
was
wasting
her
time
.

there
were
no
other
options
available
(
i
only
brought
my
check
card
to
cover
any
overage
cost
)
and
she
rang
it
up
and
applied
it
to
the
gift
card
before
telling
me
about
the
tip
policy
.

i
will
not
be
visiting
mama
mia
's
again
.

there
are
other
places
with
food
just
as
good
with
management
that
values
customers
and
employees
much
more
.

dining
at
texas
roadhouse

texas
roadhouse
has
very
good
meals
,
that
the
meat
comes
right
off
the
bones
.

it
has
very
good
prices
.

on
a
bad
note
the
waiting
area
is
not
enjoyable
or
enough
seats
.

also
,
there
should
not
be
peanuts
all
over
the
floor
.

next
,
there
should
only
be
one
person
bringing
you
your
food
.

it
s
not
a
big
deal
but
i
had
to
take
my
salad
home
because
they
forgot
to
bring
it
.

i
had
to
ask
the
girl
who
brought
my
food
and
she
never
came
back
to
let
me
know
.

i
had
to
wait
for
my
waitress
.

when
you
first
come
in
the
hostess
is
not
very
friendly
,
there
is
just
a
bunch
of
workers
standing
there
.

i
was
there
on
march
6th
,
2009
.

i
was
also
there
of
july
4th
2008
,
when
my
daughter
s
buffalo
wings
came
out
with
a
fly
on
it
.

the
manager
came
over
and
said
he
was
sorry
and
gave
a
new
batch
of
wings
,
he
said
we
ca
nt
really
do
anything
because
the
doors
are
always
opening
and
closing
.

in
my
opinion
should
of
just
took
off
the
price
of
the
wings
from
the
bill
.

but
everyone
has
there
own
way
!!!!!!

mezza
luna
ftw
!

their
mezza
luna's
are
deffly
better
than
the
pizza
rolls
.

it
s
like
a
pizza
roll
,
but
they
just
toss
ham
and
cheese
inside
.

it
seems
like
it
s
healthier
too
,
but
it
s
prolly
not
.

also
,
you
can
call
em
ahead
of
time
,
and
then
go
to
pick
up
ur
food
,
or
have
it
delivered
**
.

that
cuts
down
on
teh
wait
time
,
cus
u
can
do
other
stuff
while
u
r
waiting
.

it
usually
takes
20
mins
for
a
mezza
luna
,
as
they
have
to
add
pure
delicious
extract
to
the
mix
.

their
pizza
was
a
little
salty
for
me
,
but
it
s
still
good
.

they
do
that
whole
thing
where
you
sandwich
the
pepperoni
between
layers
of
cheese
for
+
32
delicious
.

anyways
,
the
mezza
luna
:
you
should
try
it
.

it
runs
you
about
4
bucks
and
it
deals
crushing
blows
to
hunger
.

**
edit
:
living
on
campus
at
clarkson
university
,
i
have
had
food
delivered
before
.

this
was
back
between
'05
and
'09
and
i
do
n't
remember
how
many
times
we
've
had
it
delivered
.

perhaps
they
do
n't
deliver
anymore
,
but
the
deliciousness
of
a
mezza
luna
certainly
warrants
a
pickup
.

my
2004
x
-
type
was
getting
close
to
100,000
miles
so
it
was
time
for
an
upgrade
.

i
sent
my
wife
and
daughter
over
to
check
out
a
pre-owned
2009
xf
.

michael
chestney
was
very
pleasant
and
patient
with
my
wife
and
she
suggested
i
go
check
it
out
.

i
went
in
later
that
afternoon
and
met
with
michael
.

he
showed
me
the
car
i
was
interested
in
and
we
took
a
test
drive
.

i
loved
the
car
so
we
began
negotiating
my
trade
-
in
and
the
price
of
the
09
xf
.

the
entire
negotiation
took
about
20
minutes
.

fair
give
and
take
on
both
sides
until
we
agreed
on
a
deal
that
was
within
my
parameters
and
was
fair
to
both
sides
.

10
minutes
of
paperwork
and
i
was
the
owner
of
a
beautiful
pre-owned
09
xf
.

i
have
purchased
over
15
vehicles
(
cars
,
rvs
,
and
boats
)
in
my
lifetime
and
i
have
to
say
the
experience
with
michael
and
barrett
motor
cars
of
san
antonio
was
one
of
the
best
.

friendly
,
knowledgeable
,
and
above
all
fair
.

that
's
all
you
can
really
ask
from
a
car
dealer
and
michael
and
barrett
hit
all
3
.

thanks
for
the
great
deal
and
the
great
car
!

identity
theft

myself
and
my
fiance
's
identity
was
stolen
from
the
office
staff
.

we
were
told
by
a
detective
and
asked
to
check
our
credit
for
anything
unusual
.

luckily
they
caught
the
crooks
before
they
did
one
on
us
.

it
was
a
black
female
that
use
to
work
in
the
office
.

she
stole
the
information
and
gave
it
to
another
guy
that
did
all
the
work
.

the
other
guy
was
pulled
over
one
day
and
a
cop
saw
suspicious
papers
with
names
and
social
security
numbers
on
it
.

that
s
how
they
were
caught
.

they
both
went
to
jail
and
a
new
manager
was
put
in
charge
of
the
apartments
.

the
apartment
across
from
mine
belonged
to
a
gang
of
hookers
.

nobody
lived
there
.

a
girl
would
show
up
,
then
a
guy
in
a
nice
car
would
show
up
.

short
time
later
the
guy
would
leave
,
then
the
girl
.

my
apartment
was
usually
quiet
.

i
lived
in
one
that
did
not
face
the
parking
lot
.

parking
spaces
are
just
big
enough
for
a
mini
cooper
.

it
sucked
having
an
suv
.

if
i
found
a
spot
,
i
could
nt
fit
in
it
.

gates
worked
30
%
of
the
time
at
best
.

bugs
were
a
small
problem
,
nothing
too
bad
.

the
best
there
is
in
service
.

i
was
recently
traveling
down
i
-
24
from
nashville
with
my
3
young
children
and
had
a
blowout
on
the
southeast
side
of
murfreesboro
.

it
was
4:50
when
a
friend
told
me
to
call
bud
,
he
would
take
care
of
me
.

not
only
did
they
answer
the
phone
at
4:50
on
a
thursday
,
they
hit
the
ground
moving
!.

they
tracked
down
the
only
tire
that
fit
my
bmw
330i
in
murfreesboro
within
minutes
and
secured
it
,
then
they
came
out
,
took
off
my
tire
(
it
was
a
runflat
-
but
runflats
do
n't
do
you
any
good
if
they
blow
out
)
,
and
brought
it
to
their
shop
to
change
the
tire
.

they
were
back
quickly
considering
how
far
outside
of
murfreesboro
we
were
and
had
us
on
our
way
by
6:30
that
evening
.

thanks
bud
for
all
of
your
help
and
taking
time
away
from
your
family
that
evening
.

it
's
without
a
doubt
,
the
best
service
experience
i
've
ever
had
and
just
to
be
clear
,
the
price
he
charged
me
was
the
same
as
my
tire
guy
in
nashville
's
price
for
putting
on
the
other
rear
tire
.

i
hope
i
can
return
the
favor
in
the
future
!

service
and
client
base
not
ok
.

i
have
stayed
in
this
hotel
many
times
,
and
while
it
typically
offers
a
decent
bang
for
the
buck
,
its
client
base
largely
consists
of
troubled
youngsteers
and
evictees
from
the
local
,
not
so
pleasant
hood
.

i
have
never
considered
this
a
real
problem
as
i
travel
without
kids
and
can
fend
for
myself
,
but
when
i
had
to
listen
to
a
(
non-violent
)
domestic
fight
that
lasted
from
1
am
to
5
am
during
my
last
stay
and
i
found
out
that
the
front
desk
was
unmanned
during
night
hours
,
my
choice
was
to
either
waste
tax
payers
money
by
calling
for
a
yet
another
police
dispatch
to
this
hotel
,
or
just
get
over
it
.

i
chose
the
later
,
but
approached
the
front
desk
about
the
hotel
policy
to
push
over
their
responsibilities
on
local
authorities
,
not
to
mention
the
good
night
s
sleep
i
paid
for
but
did
nt
get
.

i
was
told
management
would
call
me
back
but
still
waiting
for
that
call
.

i
will
probably
stay
here
again
because
it
s
cheap
and
i
ca
nt
afford
a
better
hotel
,
but
do
not
look
forward
to
it
and
would
definitely
not
recommend
this
hotel
for
families
or
single
female
travellers
.

was
there
this
past
weekend
and
the
guy
behind
the
counter
yelled
at
me
and
my
son
because
we
believed
he
left
the
grandma
slice
in
the
oven
a
little
too
long
and
the
cheese
got
all
dried
out
and
the
slice
tasted
more
like
a
cracker
.

he
preceded
to
grab
the
slice
off
the
countertop
and
throw
it
into
the
trash
while
yelling
at
me
saying
,
"
you
do
not
order
what
you
do
not
know
about
"
and
"
you
do
n't
know
how
pizza
is
made
"
.

it
was
very
upsetting
to
see
this
kind
of
behavior
especially
in
front
of
my
four
year
old
.

he
was
in
the
process
of
making
me
a
pie
and
when
i
got
home
,
the
pie
was
the
worst
i
have
ever
seen
.

cheese
was
falling
off
,
so
oily
and
greasy
.

i
think
he
did
it
on
purpose
because
of
my
simple
request
for
another
slice
of
grandma
that
was
n't
so
well
-
done
(
actually
,
burnt
)
.

i
will
never
go
back
to
this
place
and
i
am
reporting
them
to
the
better
business
bureau
for
such
horrible
customer
relations
and
basically
sabotaging
my
pizza
and
taking
my
$
25
.

this
story
is
100
%
true
.

that
little
man
who
thinks
he
invented
pizza
can
kiss

*ss
.

long
lines
,
silly
rules
,
rude
staff
,
ok
food

the
first
thing
you
notice
when
you
arrive
on
location
is
that
the
waiting
line
literally
goes
out
the
door
and
spills
into
the
parking
lot
.

a
restaurant
with
this
many
patrons
willing
to
stand
in
line
just
to
order
tacos
must
be
good
,
right
?

i
mean
,
that
's
the
way
it
works
at
amusement
parks
:
the
longest
lines
are
at
the
best
rides
.

well
,
this
may
be
an
exception
.

the
staff
taking
your
order
and
"
waiting
"
on
you
are
very
indifferent
and
have
no
sense
of
costumer
service
at
all
.

i
have
gotten
better
results
talking
to
comcast
customer
service
than
with
these
folks
.

and
do
n't
even
think
about
asking
to
speak
to
the
manager
because
this
guy
is
,
and
pardon
my
french
,
a
jerk
.

if
you
have
gotten
through
ordering
,
dealing
with
the
rude
staff
and
if
you
followed
the
dumb
rules
,
you
are
finally
presented
with
what
you
came
for
..
some
tacos
that
are
"
ok
,
"
but
definitely
not
worth
putting
up
with
all
the
hassle
.

save
yourself
the
trouble
and
skip
this
place
all
together
.

i
suggest
you
go
up
to
raging
taco
&
raging
burrito
a
couple
of
blocks
up
the
street
or
even
taco
mac
.

wish
this
was
in
saratoga
--

we
were
introduced
to
bistro
tallulah
by
traveler
-
professional
diner
who
happens
to
own
the
adelphi
hotel
and
travels
the
world
--
and
residing
in
paris
,
london
,
new
york
the
rest
of
the
year
.

she
knows
great
food
and
dining
experiences
.

she
was
dead
on
--
this
restaurant
was
wonderful
---
do
not
be
put
off
by
the
one
negative
review
on
this
page
.

i
can
tell
you
we
were
pleasantly
surprised
--
bt
has
taste
memory
and
each
time
back
the
food
was
consistently
delicious
--
same
dishes
--
were
consistent
.

our
friend
is
a
world
traveler
and
loves
unpretentious
dining
experiences
and
inspired
food
.

this
chef
knows
what
he
is
doing
.

treat
yourself
and
go
--
you
will
go
back
!

i
am
a
business
owner
in
downtown
saratoga
springs
and
wish
this
restaurant
was
in
our
town
!

the
affordable
rent
makes
it
possible
for
an
inspired
chef
to
serve
his
high
quality
fare
at
affordable
prices
!

unlike
saratoga
.

i
rrly
seek
the
cehf
out
to
introduce
myself
--
but
the
second
time
we
went
--
i
made
a
point
of
asking
our
wait
person
to
introduce
my
friend
and
myself
to
the
chef
to
tell
him
just
how
good
our
meals
were
.

can
not
wait
to
go
gain

i
think
that
the
re
pretty
good
.

first
of
all
,
if
you
call
for
an
appointment
they
wo
n't
tell
you
to
call
back
a
month
later
so
you
can
then
make
one
.

they
also
do
n't
tell
you
that
they
're
going
to
mail
you
an
"
application
"
to
be
admitted
to
be
a
patient
.

i
feel
that
the
way
some
doctor
s
offices
work
around
here
is
a
little
bit
absurd
so
i
'm
happy
that
these
guys
do
n't
do
those
two
things
in
particlular
.

usually
you
can
be
seen
the
same
week
or
maybe
the
following
week
.

the
doctor
did
tell
me
that
my
male
pattern
baldness
is
due
to
my
mother
s
father
because
the
gene
is
exclusively
passed
on
through
maternal
line
but
that
's
a
common
misconception
(
http://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-living/beauty-personal-care/hair-loss-10-08/hair-loss.htm
)
.

in
general
i
would
say
that
the
staff
is
attentive
and
nice
.

but
then
again
i
was
nice
to
them
so
that
could
have
been
why
.

anyhow
,
after
reading
some
of
the
other
reviews
it
seems
like
some
of
the
other
reviewers
are
expecting
mircles
.

if
you
want
miracles
you
'll
have
to
go
to
21st
st
.

it
's
a
pretty
typical
primary
care
office
but
for
the
area
it
's
very
good
.

they
do
n't
do
certain
things
that
are
really
annoying
about
other
offices
.

first
trip
to
canada

i
recently
traveled
to
canada
on
business
and
had
a
most
excellent
experience
.

i
work
for
a
large
retail
company
recently
expanding
our
operations
into
canada
and
had
to
travel
to
ensure
all
of
our
computer
network
equipment
was
installed
properly
and
on
time
.

this
can
tend
to
be
a
stressful
experience
in
itself
let
alone
adding
crossing
boarders
for
the
first
time
.

i
was
very
pleased
to
find
my
accommodations
and
the
hotel
staff
to
be
a
very
calming
and
comforting
part
of
my
trip
.

i
found
the
hotel
to
be
amazingly
clean
,
not
to
mention
very
well
adorned
with
many
pleasant
surprises
.

from
my
first
encounter
at
check
in
to
my
regrettable
check
out
i
found
the
staff
and
facility
to
exceed
my
expectation
.

i
completely
enjoyed
my
whole
check
in
experience
and
was
impressed
with
the
friendliness
and
professionalism
of
the
staff
as
well
as
the
accommodations
themselves
.

i
will
be
traveling
in
this
area
in
the
future
and
you
can
be
assured
that
this
experience
will
be
helpful
in
my
choice
of
hotels
and
novotel
will
be
my
first
selection
.

yes
the
parking
can
be
a
challenge
but
being
from
nj
i
am
no
stranger
to
tight
corners
.

please
pass
my
appreciation
to
the
staff
and
management
for
their
excellent
hospitality
and
good
spirits
as
it
helped
make
a
stressful
trip
enjoyable
.

update
:
i
had
to
add
to
my
review
.

i
was
just
in
last
night
and
had
a
chance
to
dine
in
their
new
dining
room
.

amazing
!

i
frequent
this
resturant
on
a
weekly
basis
but
usally
only
for
lunch
.

well
i
was
in
for
a
treat
when
i
was
greeted
by
the
friendly
girls
at
the
counter
who
asked
if
my
wife
and
i
would
like
to
sit
in
their
"
new
"
dining
room
.

right
away
they
told
us
that
it
was
the
same
great
food
with
the
same
prices
so
off
we
went
.

we
were
greeted
again
and
sat
promptly
.

after
looking
at
the
menu
and
seeing
the
new
menu
items
they
had
,
we
knew
we
were
in
for
a
treat
!

i
had
the
chicken
parmesan
dinner
and
my
wife
had
the
shrimp
scampi
dinner
.

amazing
!

the
portions
were
generous
enough
that
we
even
took
some
home
!

i
have
to
say
the
value
of
this
place
always
amazes
me
.

it
's
nice
to
see
that
even
in
the
economy
we
can
eat
a
place
that
has
upscale
service
,
amazing
atmosphere
,
and
incredible
food
,
but
not
break
the
bank
while
enjoying
it
!

bottom
line
is
that
when
it
's
a
small
privatly
owned
resturant
like
this
is
you
can
tell
that
the
owners
and
employees
take
pride
in
their
product
and
service
.

well
done
!

great
work
and
honest
establishment
!

i
typically
have
work
done
on
my
jeep
at
the
dealership
,
but
it
is
6
years
old
now
and
getting
charged
dealership
prices
just
did
n't
seem
cost
effective
anymore
.

i
had
tried
out
few
place
around
the
area
and
had
been
ripped
off
a
few
times
.

i
had
hear
great
things
about
phet
and
g&g
automotive
so
i
decided
to
give
him
a
try
.

the
service
was
excellent
and
personable
.

he
checked
out
what
i
needed
to
have
done
told
me
what
needed
be
fixed
before
he
did
any
work
and
did
great
repair
work
.

the
price
was
actually
lower
than
what
i
had
anticipated
and
used
to
compared
to
other
places
,
plus
he
showed
me
the
work
he
did
when
i
came
in
to
pick
up
the
car
.

also
,
a
week
after
the
work
,
phet
called
me
up
to
see
how
my
car
was
running
and
to
let
me
know
that
they
had
accidentally
overcharged
me
for
part
of
the
work
and
wanted
to
give
me
a
refund
for
that
amount
.

that
is
just
unheard
of
these
days
!

i
grew
up
in
a
small
town
where
you
knew
and
trusted
your
mechanic
and
was
really
cynical
about
city
auto
repair
shops
since
i
moved
here
,
but
phet
has
shown
that
there
really
are
honest
hard
working
mechanics
around
.

he
is
my
mechanic
going
forward
!

our
company
is
a
high
end
designer
handbag
and
fashion
accessories
company
,
thus
we
are
certainly
a
niche
market
.

we
had
been
evaluating
seo
providers
for
quite
some
time
and
finally
decided
to
take
the
plunge
with
stuart
,
and
ulistic
.

we
made
the
decision
for
a
couple
of
reasons
.

1
.
social
media
.

we
were
familiar
with
search
engine
optimization
strategies
,
but
new
nothing
about
social
media
-
we
just
heard
that
it
was
the
next
big
thing
.

2
.
we
really
liked
the
fact
that
stuart
sets
defined
objectives
and
we
meet
once
a
month
to
go
over
our
key
performance
indicators
.

how
has
it
gone
so
far
?

well
we
have
been
working
with
ulistic
for
1.5
months
,
and
have
100
people
following
our
site
on
facebook
,
and
our
web
site
,
www.designofashion.com
has
seen
a
3
fold
increase
in
traffic
,
which
is
significantly
beating
our
expectations
-
seo
is
a
process
that
takes
time
and
to
get
results
this
quickly
is
exceptional
.

we
are
absolutely
confident
that
stuart
's
ethical
and
focused
strategies
will
see
these
trends
continue
to
grow
,
and
our
business
will
reap
the
rewards
of
this
program
.

finally
,
it
must
be
said
that
stuart
is
a
fantastic
person
to
work
with
,
because
of
his
solid
strategies
and
equally
as
importantly
because
he
is
a
genuinely
good
person
and
a
great
communicator
.

excellent
service
and
quality

i
had
hom
-
excel
replace
most
of
the
windows
in
my
tampa
residence
three
years
ago
.

the
excellent
windows
have
performed
without
any
problems
,
but
that
's
not
why
i
'm
writing
my
review
.

three
weeks
ago
,
burglars
tried
to
gain
entry
into
the
rear
of
my
home
.

the
intruders
slit
the
screen
of
the
window
.

next
,
they
tried
to
force
the
window
with
a
pry
bar
and
then
to
break
the
window
with
a
hammer
.

the
window
did
n't
break
!

my
next
-
door
neighbor
heard
the
noise
and
turned
on
a
light
,
thankfully
scaring
the
two
miscreants
away
(
they
even
left
their
hammer
behind
!
)
.

i
called
home
-
excel
the
next
day
to
order
a
replacement
screen
for
the
window
,
and
was
happily
surprised
when
they
said
that
they
were
n't
even
going
to
charge
me
for
the
replacement
screen
...
that
it
would
be
covered
under
their
guarentee
.

lo
and
behold
,
they
replaced
the
screen
(
which
had
to
be
ordered
)
yesterday
and
did
n't
charge
me
a
dime
.

their
worker
even
cleaned
3
of
my
windows
and
changed
a
lightbulb
for
me
.

in
this
day
and
age
,
it
is
so
rare
to
find
a
company
with
such
nice
workers
and
such
far
ranging
guarantee
policies
.

i
rarely
write
reviews
such
as
this
one
,
but
they
certainly
deserve
anyone
's
business
!

friendly
staff
,
but
definitely
some
problems

may
,
2009
.

we
were
booked
at
the
sheraton
with
a
number
of
other
out
-
of
-
town
wedding
guests
.

got
put
into
the
wrong
room
the
first
night
,
and
were
quite
surprised
to
have
someone
with
the
same
room
key
trying
to
get
in
the
door
at
1:00
am
!

next
day
got
moved
into
another
room
,
on
the
same
floor
with
other
wedding
guests
.

there
were
3
adults
in
our
room
but
towels
for
only
2
,
no
linens
for
sofa
bed
.

in
the
second
room
it
took
3
tries
to
get
all
the
towels
and
linens
we
requested
.

a
package
and
some
wedding
cards
were
left
in
our
first
room
.

they
were
sent
to
our
second
room
and
had
been
opened
--
the
ribbon
-
wrapped
present
,
and
all
3
envelopes
.

security
in
the
hotel
seemed
to
be
excellent
,
but
we
were
never
given
an
explanation
as
to
why
someone
would
open
these
items
.

a
mid-afternoon
"
fire
drill
"
was
disruptive
,
putting
everyone
out
of
the
hotel
.

when
we
called
the
front
desk
about
an
extremely
boisterous
crowd
in
the
hall
outside
our
door
quite
late
at
night
,
it
seemed
to
take
the
hotel
staff
quite
a
while
to
quiet
them
down
.

the
staff
was
friendly
,
especially
the
front
desk
female
supervisor
,
and
seemed
to
want
to
help
,
but
too
many
unusual
things
happened
to
make
us
want
to
stay
there
again
.

be
careful
of
who
your
sales
guy
is

i
think
this
place
is
probably
really
great
especially
judging
by
the
reviews
on
here
.

my
experience
was
awful
though
.

it
all
had
to
do
with
the
sales
guy
which
was
a
young
22
year
old
who
had
admittedly
only
been
working
for
2
weeks
.

i
was
extremely
interested
in
the
car
and
very
likely
would
have
bought
it
,
but
the
sales
guy
i
dealt
with
ruined
the
deal
.

essentially
,
i
told
him
i
did
n't
trust
him
cause
he
was
a
car
salesman
,
but
he
got
so
incredibly
offended
at
that
statement
that
he
had
to
go
cry
to
another
salesman
and
compose
himself
before
coming
back
.

i
do
n't
know
if
the
kid
had
a
bad
day
or
what
,
but
i
had
to
sit
and
apologize
about
nothing
for
10
minutes
until
he
dropped
the
issue
.

after
that
,
i
just
tried
to
ignore
his
lack
of
professionalism
and
test
drive
the
car
.

i
played
dumb
and
asked
him
questions
that
i
already
knew
the
answers
to
and
he
responded
with
half
truths
and
a
few
falsehoods
.

for
instance
i
asked
who
owned
mazda
and
he
said
with
confidence
that
was
gm
,
which
is
n't
true
.

i
mean
,
i
do
n't
care
if
he
does
n't
know
,
but
if
he
pretends
to
know
and
tells
me
bs
to
my
face
,
there
's
no
way
i
'm
going
to
trust
him
when
matters
turn
to
the
price
of
the
car
and
financing
.

the
worst
chinese
i
've
ever
had

this
is
by
far
the
worst
chinese
food
i
have
ever
had
.

the
service
stunk
.

i
called
in
my
order
and
upon
arriving
to
pick
it
up
,
they
got
my
order
confused
with
someone
else
s
.

they
helped
about
three
other
people
before
they
offered
to
help
me
again
.

they
also
got
my
friend
s
order
mixed
up
and
wanted
to
charger
her
$
10
more
than
what
she
had
wanted
.

she
asked
for
the
dinner
combo
and
they
gave
her
two
dinner
plates
instead
.

we
were
standing
in
the
store
for
20
minutes
to
simply
pick
up
an
order
.

not
to
mention
that
the
wait
staff
was
about
as
pleasant
as
dealing
with
an
angry
bull
.

they
were
abrasive
and
rude
-
when
they
were
the
ones
who
messed
everything
up
.

we
had
to
throw
out
about
80
percent
of
our
meals
because
the
food
tasted
so
horrible
.

i
do
nt
know
how
it
is
possible
to
make
orange
chicken
,
sesame
chicken
and
kung
pao
chicken
as
well
as
cheese
puffs
taste
that
bad
but
china
delight
accomplished
that
.

the
only
thing
that
was
edible
was
the
steamed
rice
and
the
vegetable
lo
mein
was
barely
tolerable
.

i
will
never
go
here
again
.

lucky
panda
in
willis
is
a
billion
times
better
in
service
and
quality
of
the
meal
.

i
have
no
idea
how
china
delight
won
number
1
chinese
restaurant
in
montgomery
-
there
needs
to
be
a
recount
on
that
vote
.

terrible
service

one
of
the
worst
experiences
i
've
ever
had
with
a
auto
repair
shop
.

we
took
our
vehicle
in
for
a
repair
to
the
air
conditioning
.

approx
4
months
later
,
the
compressor
went
out
.

we
took
it
back
in
to
have
it
repaired
again
,
and
less
than
a
week
later
the
second
compressor
went
out
.

we
went
in
for
a
third
visit
and
they
fixed
it
again
,
but
this
time
when
we
picked
up
the
car
,
the
radio
and
clock
did
not
work
.

so
for
the
4th
time
in
5
months
and
the
third
time
in
2
weeks
,
we
brought
the
car
back
again
.

when
we
expressed
our
discontent
to
the
manager
(
that
's
right
,
the
manager
)
,
did
he
say
he
would
return
some
money
,
did
he
say
he
would
give
a
discount
on
our
next
visit
,
did
he
just
say
"
i
'm
sorry
"
.

nope
,
none
of
the
above
.

he
stood
there
and
told
us
how
he
was
n't
at
fault
.

it
was
the
fault
of
the
parts
supplier
,
and
can
we
imagine
how
he
felt
having
to
put
another
2
hours
of
work
in
the
car
.

and
what
did
we
expect
...
that
he
bench
test
every
part
.

at
no
time
during
the
conversation
did
the
words
,
"
i
'm
sorry
"
ever
come
out
of
his
mouth
.

i
,
nor
anyone
else
in
my
family
,
will
ever
go
to
sun
devil
auto
again
.

well
,
unless
of
course
the
third
compressor
he
put
in
the
car
goes
out
.

do
not
use
this
company
!

i
dropped
off
a
sheet
metal
piece
that
i
needed
copied
due
to
th
it
was
needing
to
be
replaced
.

i
asked
if
they
could
copy
the
piece
i
dropped
off
.

they
said
it
would
be
made
exactly
like
the
one
i
needed
to
replace
.

i
picked
it
up
when
it
was
finished
and
was
charge
30.00
.

when
i
got
to
the
job
and
tried
to
insert
the
new
piece
of
metal
it
would
not
fit
!!

i
took
the
original
piece
of
metal
and
rigged
it
to
make
due
since
i
had
to
complete
the
job
.

i
took
the
receipt
and
the
metal
that
did
not
fit
and
asked
pomper
for
my
money
back
.

the
girl
at
the
desk
was
sooo
rude
i
could
not
believe
it
!

she
told
me
she
could
not
use
the
piece
i
was
returning
and
the
company
would
only
put
it
in
the
trash
so
i
could
not
return
it
.

i
explained
i
did
not
get
what
i
paid
for
.

she
asked
me
to
bring
the
original
piece
back
and
i
told
her
i
had
to
use
it
on
the
job
.

she
told
me
that
was
to
bad
she
would
do
nothing
to
help
me
since
she
could
not
use
or
resell
the
piece
.

i
said
i
was
going
to
trash
it
also
and
could
i
at
least
have
a
credit
.

with
a
smirk
on
her
face
she
told
me
no
money
is
being
returned
and
that
is
the
way
it
was
.

do
not
use
this
company
.

there
are
to
many
people
that
need
our
business
to
have
to
put
up
with
this
unfair
treatment
!!!!!

i
would
never
recommend
this
gym
to
anyone
and
unfortunately
this
is
based
solely
on
the
owner
's
own
unprofessionalism
.

when
i
originally
joined
in
january
i
only
did
so
because
i
was
told
i
would
be
able
to
cancel
the
12
month
membership
if
i
was
to
move
away
.

i
signed
up
with
one
of
the
staff
who
was
very
pleasant
and
professional
.

actually
working
out
there
was
good
-
the
machines
are
nice
and
the
classes
are
fun
.

the
locker
room
is
certainly
lacking
-
i
would
never
shower
or
change
there
.

they
need
to
update
the
locker
rooms
asap
.

back
to
my
poor
rating
-
i
was
excepted
to
medical
school
and
went
in
to
cancel
my
membership
as
i
was
told
i
could
do
since
i
was
moving
away
.

the
owner
was
very
rude
,
accused
me
of
not
reading
my
contract
,
and
basically
told
me
to
shut
up
when
i
was
trying
to
ask
questions
to
further
understand
the
process
of
canceling
my
membership
.

i
was
able
to
cancel
it
but
only
after
paying
a
$
50
fee
(
which
the
staff
person
who
signed
me
up
stated
i
would
not
have
to
pay
if
i
had
proof
of
moving
)
and
being
spoken
to
in
a
very
belittling
manner
.

i
would
understand
if
i
was
being
treated
this
way
by
a
staff
member
but
the
club
's
actual
owner
?!

bad
for
business
.

i
was
appalled
.

i
will
never
recommend
this
gym
to
any
woman
.

the
equipment
and
classes
are
n't
good
enough
to
deal
with
the
rudeness
from
the
staff
!!!

there
are
better
places
on
the
cape

the
salon
experience
from
hell

i
feel
obligated
to
share
this
story
.

right
out
of
college
i
called
the
salon
and
explained
my
situation
.

just
graduated
,
just
moved
,
not
rich
,
and
starting
new
job
soon
.

i
never
got
a
price
quote
over
the
phone
and
they
take
your
cc
info
just
to
make
the
appointment
because
if
you
do
n't
show
up
,
they
'll
charge
you
.

i
had
this
ridiculous
celebrity
stylist
from
la
named
derrick
.

after
he
already
put
product
on
my
hair
he
said
"
i
should
warn
you
,
i
'm
expensive
.
"

what
was
i
supposed
to
do
,
say
i
ca
n't
afford
you
and
walk
out
with
crap
all
over
my
hair
.

i
wanted
to
be
very
blonde
and
instead
he
pulled
my
root
color
throughout
my
whole
hair
which
is
a
gross
mousey
brown
.

the
other
stylists
around
me
kept
pressuring
me
saying
he
's
so
wonderful
,
you
're
going
to
love
your
hair
.

$
400
later
my
jaw
dropped
when
the
receptionist
told
me
the
total
.

derrick
did
a
terrible
job
,
was
a
complete
jerk
the
entire
time
,
and
i
had
no
warning
as
to
the
price
.

i
cried
the
entire
way
home
.

he
then
"
fixed
"
it
for
free
but
it
still
looked
like
crap
.

i
will
never
go
back
.

it
was
the
salon
experience
from
absolutely
hell
.

he
also
told
me
that
he
worked
on
the
cast
of
will
and
grace
and
that
they
were
all
jerks
.

that
's
my
favorite
show
of
all
time
.

i
'm
pretty
sure
for
the
cast
that
it
was
the
other
way
around
.

maybe
he
did
n't
do
a
good
job
and
they
told
him
so
.

absolute
nightmare
!

stay
away
!

very
unhappy
...

working
with
rod
jacobsen
was
my
first
experience
working
with
a
cpa
,
so
i
did
not
know
what
to
expect
.

that
said
-
he
seemed
to
be
doing
well
enough
.

however
,
then
i
asked
to
amend
my
return
to
apply
a
credit
i
had
just
become
eligible
for
.

i
expected
to
pay
for
this
service
,
but
imagine
my
surprise
when
i
received
a
bill
for
more
than
what
i
paid
to
have
the
original
return
prepared
.

asked
why
,
rod
simply
told
me
that
he
had
to
research
how
to
do
the
amendment
(
it
was
an
amended
to
show
that
i
had
purchased
a
home
-
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
,
one
would
think
)
and
that
took
time
to
figure
out
.

well
,
that
was
strike
one
.

i
was
n't
going
to
use
them
again
,
but
i
was
going
to
leave
it
at
that
.

however
,
now
that
i
have
come
to
realize
that
i
am
going
to
owe
the
irs
$
6,000
+
despite
doing
exactly
what
rod
told
me
to
do
,
i
feel
i
have
to
voice
my
opinion
.

last
year
,
after
all
was
said
and
done
,
i
asked
rod
whether
my
payment
structure
would
leave
me
with
no
/
little
tax
liability
at
the
end
of
the
year
.

he
said
yes
.

well
,
again
,
i
am
now
faced
with
a
tax
bill
of
$
6,000
+
,
all
due
on
april
15
,
2010
and
all
that
rod
has
to
say
to
the
matter
is
'
well
,
you
wo
n't
have
to
pay
a
penalty
.
'

i
may
not
have
to
pay
a
penalty
,
yet
,
but
this
is
not
what
i
had
in
mind
when
hired
these
guys
.

in
the
words
of
my
new
accountant
,
they
let
me
down
!

bit
sketchy
,
sporadic
delivery
times

i
bought
about
half
of
the
furniture
i
own
from
this
place
.

why
?

because
they
cut
me
good
deals
if
i
paid
in
cash
.

sketchy
,
right
?

well
they
came
through
and
delivered
almost
all
of
my
items
within
a
few
days
.

(
they
even
got
me
a
couch
pretty
quickly
.
)

the
guy
who
was
cutting
me
the
deals
and
getting
me
the
furniture
quickly
,
ahmed
,
was
nice
and
mostly
professional
,
except
the
semi-sketchiness
.

then
one
day
,
ahmed
left
the
country
,
not
to
return
for
months
,
without
informing
me
.

he
also
neglected
to
tell
the
other
person
working
at
the
store
about
a
dining
room
table
that
i
had
ordered
and
that
was
supposed
to
be
coming
in
.

the
other
person
working
at
the
store
did
n't
know
that
i
still
had
this
table
coming
.

i
had
paid
in
cash
,
and
he
said
he
had
no
receipt
/
record
of
my
purchase
.

i
came
back
with
the
receipt
ahmed
had
provided
upon
my
purchase
,
and
the
guy
took
forever
to
copy
it
but
said
that
he
would
take
care
of
the
situation
.

i
waited
.

and
waited
.

he
never
once
contacted
us
.

i
've
had
to
pester
this
new
guy
several
times
to
ask
when
my
table
will
arrive
.

he
kept
saying
different
arrival
/
delivery
dates
and
did
n't
seem
terribly
apologetic
.

it
has
been
3
weeks
and
i
still
do
n't
have
my
table
(
which
was
not
cheap
,
i
might
add
)
.

point
is
:
you
might
be
able
to
get
a
good
deal
on
some
nice
furniture
--
which
i
did
--
but
they
're
not
very
communicative
and
god
forbid
something
goes
wrong
,
you
'll
have
to
fight
to
get
it
resolved
.

poor
service

run
do
n't
walk
.

my
experience
with
home
delivery
service
has
been
one
of
disappointment
and
anger
.

if
i
could
give
them
a
lower
rating
than
poor
i
would
.

on
august
21st
,
2009
i
ordered
furniture
from
hickory
furniture
mart
and
contracted
for
hds
to
deliver
it
.

after
seventeen
days
the
delivery
van
showed
up
at
my
home
minus
two
pieces
.

i
was
later
told
they
had
been
left
at
the
warehouse
and
some
future
date
they
would
be
delivered
.

no
one
will
give
me
a
date
.

i
spent
$
2300
on
the
bedroom
suite
,
which
was
complete
and
excellent
condition
on
the
showroom
floor
.

upon
delivery
it
was
clear
the
entire
set
was
damaged
:
a
piece
of
wood
was
broke
on
the
headboard
;
the
chest
of
drawers
was
missing
all
four
pieces
necessary
to
attach
the
legs
;
the
dresser
back
legs
were
pushed
in
causing
the
dresser
to
lean
into
the
wall
;
and
a
nighstand
was
missing
a
drawer
.

how
do
you
lose
a
drawer
.

after
complaining
on
september
10th
to
national
home
furnishings
,
boyles
,
the
hickory
furniture
mart
and
home
delivery
service
the
latter
finally
called
me
back
and
said
they
would
be
up
to
pick
the
dresser
and
chest
of
drawers
at
some
future
point
and
at
some
later
point
it
would
be
professional
repaired
and
at
some
later
point
it
would
be
returned
.

the
customer
service
at
home
delivery
service
was
terrible
let
alone
their
promise
to
proper
set
up
furniture
.

so
i
am
in
limbo
regarding
a
bedroom
suite
.

i
hope
the
owners
and
employees
of
this
store
have
broken
bedroom
suites
in
their
homes
and
furniture
sitting
in
someone
's
warehouse
.

maybe
then
they
will
begin
to
understand
poor
customer
service
and
terrible
sit
up
service
.

excellent
driving
school

i
was
involved
in
a
car
accident
20
years
ago
and
since
then
i
've
been
a
nervous
wreck
and
have
n't
been
behind
the
wheel
.

unfortunately
,
a
family
emergency
required
me
to
conquer
this
fear
.

a
very
good
friend
of
mine
highly
recommended
the
professional
driving
school
and
i
was
told
to
specifically
ask
for
gerry
.

she
highly
recommended
him
and
described
him
as
the
"
saintly
instructor
and
simply
the
best
instructor
there
is
....
very
calm
,
pleasant
and
very
detailed
in
giving
instructions
"
.

i
called
the
school
most
probably
10
times
before
i
finally
enrolled
in
a
20
hour
package
.

i
had
to
cancel
my
initial
lesson
4
times
and
on
the
5th
attempt
the
management
was
quick
enough
to
associate
my
cancellations
with
my
fear
and
finally
encouraged
me
into
taking
my
initial
lesson
.

five
minutes
before
my
initial
lesson
,
i
got
a
call
from
gerry
advising
me
of
his
arrival
and
to
come
down
as
soon
as
i
was
ready
.

my
heart
pounded
as
i
walked
down
and
pounded
even
faster
upon
seeing
gerry
in
an
suv
-
lexus
!

i
thought
of
canceling
the
lesson
once
again
because
i
did
n't
feel
comfortable
driving
an
suv
.

gerry
pleasantly
said
"
since
i
am
already
here
why
do
n't
we
give
it
shot
.

i
trust
you
and
believe
that
you
'll
be
able
to
handle
this
and
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
reciprocate
!

trust
me
and
most
especially
trust
and
believe
in
yourself
.

do
n't
worry
,
i
'll
take
care
of
you
!
"

.......
the
rest
was
history
!

here
i
am
now
driving
confidently
on
my
own
.

gerry
,
i
ca
n't
thank
you
enough
for
helping
me
cope
with
my
fear
.

to
my
friend
,
thank
you
for
your
recommendation
...
you
were
true
to
your
words
in
saying
gerry
is
a
"
saintly
instructor
...
absolutely
simple
the
best
instructor
and
best
driving
school
there
is
!

review
on
house
of
joy
chinese
restaurant

my
family
and
i
moved
to
san
antonio
a
year
ago
and
have
tried
almost
all
of
the
chinese
restaurants
because
we
love
chinese
food
.

well
it
took
us
a
while
to
find
one
that
we
liked
.

but
we
do
n't
just
like
house
of
joy
we
love
it
.

everything
we
have
gotten
there
has
been
more
authentic
and
better
tasting
than
any
other
chinese
restaurant
in
the
san
antonio
area
we
have
been
to
--
and
trust
me
we
have
been
to
a
lot
of
them
.

we
just
happen
to
stumble
across
this
little
restaurant
one
day
when
we
had
to
visit
the
bexar
county
tax
office
off
of
bandera
road
.

we
stopped
in
and
got
some
take
out
and
can
not
stop
going
back
.

they
have
the
best
egg
drop
soup
i
have
ever
tasted
.

we
also
love
their
egg
rolls
and
spring
rolls
.

and
every
entree
we
have
ordered
is
perfect
.

everything
is
always
cooked
fresh
and
tastes
fresh
.

their
prices
are
extremely
reasonable
for
the
amount
of
food
you
receive
.

the
staff
is
also
just
so
pleasant
to
deal
with
.

they
are
also
quick
at
getting
your
order
out
to
you
.

you
do
n't
have
to
sit
and
wait
around
forever
like
most
places
!!

so
anyone
looking
for
an
excellent
night
out
for
chinese
or
maybe
just
lunch
should
stop
in
and
try
it
because
i
promise
you
2
things
---
you
wo
n't
regret
it
!!

and
you
will
go
back
for
more
!!!

karla
ferguson
-
granger

ps
i
have
noticed
on
here
that
someone
left
a
comment
that
"
all
of
the
nice
comments
must
come
from
co
workers
or
friends
"
and
i
will
tell
you
that
i
do
n't
know
these
people
except
from
eating
at
their
restaurant
.

we
are
from
virginia
and
just
moved
here
a
year
ago
.

so
that
comment
is
completely
false
.

because
we
think
it
's
the
best
!!!

and
we
do
n't
know
them
except
for
eating
there
.

dr.
strzalka
at
flagship
cvts
is
not
a
good
doctor

i
am
not
sure
about
the
quality
of
the
other
doctors
there
,
but
i
do
know
from
personal
experience
that
dr.
christopher
t.
strzalka
is
not
a
man
of
his
word
,
and
is
also
very
cruel
and
uncaring
!!

he
was
going
to
operate
and
replace
my
bicuspid
aortic
valve
due
to
critical
aortic
stenosis
.

i
had
a
surgery
date
of
july
17
,
2008
.

then
he
renigged
when
he
read
my
health
care
proxy
,
even
though
i
agreed
to
be
on
the
ventilator
for
2
months
following
surgery
(
as
he
had
twice
stated
i
must
agree
to
)
.

he
later
said
that
by
2
months
he
"
meant
at
least
two
months
"
.

two
months
and
at
least
two
months
are
totally
different
things
.

he
did
not
even
give
me
the
chance
to
say
i
would
stay
on
the
ventilator
longer
,
which
i
would
have
.

a
health
care
proxy
is
not
written
in
stone
and
can
be
changed
.

he
also
never
even
said
he
was
sorry
.

just
said
i
was
inoperable
and
walked
out
of
the
hospital
room
.

so
,
therefore
,
now
he
says
i
am
inoperable
(
even
though
i
am
not
100
%
inoperable
)
,
and
he
is
letting
me
die
.

i
am
just
middle
aged
and
do
not
want
to
die
,
but
thanks
to
this
doctor
i
have
no
other
alternatives
.

i
,
along
with
my
friends
,
consider
this
doctor
to
be
the
cause
of
my
death
as
he
is
not
even
trying
to
save
my
life
by
operating
.

even
my
pa
i
went
to
the
other
day
said
"
it
must
by
comforting
to
have
gone
to
a
heart
surgeon
like
him
who
will
do
nothing
for
you
"
.

he
said
it
sarcastically
.

if
you
want
a
doctor
who
will
lie
to
you
and
say
he
will
operate
and
then
change
his
mind
,
and
not
know
what
he
is
talking
about
when
he
recommends
procedures
at
other
hospitals
and
says
they
are
what
you
need
,
when
they
will
not
work
for
you
,
go
to
this
doctor
...
he
is
the
one
for
you
.

what
you
can
learn
from
the
below
'
bad
experience
'
.

i
would
suggest
not
avoiding
second
home
based
on
the
'
bad
experience
'
review
.

i
'd
probably
be
more
inclined
to
board
my
two
dogs
here
,
seeing
that
they
do
n't
just
take
every
dog
coming
in
.

i
've
toured
this
place
and
was
impressed
by
how
clean
the
place
was
,
and
all
the
options
for
the
dogs
.

it
's
unfortunate
that
bmil
believed
that
his
'
perfect
'
dog
was
not
given
the
right
opportunity
to
prove
himself
.

but
i
've
done
hundreds
of
dog
introductions
myself
(
another
place
,
i
do
n't
work
here
)
,
and
owners
can
have
unrealistic
expectations
and
views
of
what
they
see
when
their
dogs
meet
other
dogs
.

workers
who
do
these
introductions
look
at
the
interaction
objectively
;
and
it
's
good
to
see
they
are
able
and
willing
to
say
no
if
they
feel
there
would
be
a
problem
.

it
sounds
(
according
to
your
own
statement
)
that
they
had
a
roomful
of
dogs
,
so
they
must
be
doing
something
right
-
and
are
keeping
those
dogs
safe
from
potential
problems
.

you
say
you
work
a
lot
,
and
that
you
have
a
young
dog
;
so
i
have
little
doubt
that
your
dog
is
just
filled
with
energy
to
burn
;
and
it
is
good
of
you
to
look
for
a
place
to
take
him
.

but
not
at
a
risk
to
other
people
's
pets
.

you
were
clearly
given
another
alternative
by
second
home
,
to
board
him
-
which
might
have
given
your
dog
a
chance
to
come
and
go
from
second
home
a
couple
times
,
getting
used
to
the
place
and
maybe
facilitating
another
attempt
to
get
into
daycare
later
.

no
business
is
going
to
push
customers
away
without
good
reason
;
so
is
n't
it
reasonable
to
think
they
might
know
what
they
're
doing
?

my
dogs
are
far
from
perfect
,
and
one
of
them
i
believe
would
be
a
little
much
for
daycare
here
herself
(
at
least
initially
)
.

be
a
little
more
reasonable
with
your
expectations
of
a
place
like
this
;
and
maybe
do
n't
jump
to
personal
attacks
suggesting
that
they
do
n't
want
to
work
hard
,
just
because
you
bruised
your
own
ego
.

dumbest
f'ers
ever

i
called
dominos
tonight
,
it
rang
forever
,

of
broad
.

broad
,
i
say
,
is
14th
street
and
i
am
3
blocks
west
of
broad
and
one
south
of
walnut
.

hmmm
,
she
says
,
then
why
are
you
calling
here
,
we
do
n't
go
past
broad
?

anyway
,
after
much
yelling
and
cussing
i
hung
up
,
grabbed
a
cab
,
and
went
to
geno
's
.

quick
to
take
money
but
not
quick
to
fix
a
problem
!

b&b
came
out
very
quickly
to
give
us
our
quote
back
in
june
.

they
were
very
polite
,
eager
to
answer
any
questions
and
willing
to
wait
for
us
to
return
from
vacation
to
begin
installing
our
fence
.

our
fence
was
installed
quickly
in
august
and
they
had
their
money
and
left
saying
"
workmanship
is
guaranteed
for
a
year
!
"
.

within
a
week
we
noticed
one
of
the
boards
on
our
gate
splitting
where
a
nail
had
gone
in
.

we
called
our
representative
who
assured
me
he
would
call
the
office
and
have
it
taken
care
of
.

we
heard
nothing
.

we
then
called
the
office
and
the
man
we
spoke
to
said
he
'd
send
someone
out
to
look
at
it
but
could
n't
promise
when
-
two
weeks
came
and
went
and
we
heard
nothing
.

i
just
called
again
and
was
told
that
workmanship
,
not
wood
,
is
guaranteed
for
a
year
-
well
in
my
opinion
-
the
wood
split
due
to
a
nail
which
is
part
of
workmanship
!

she
even
went
so
far
as
to
say
"
you
r
calling
about
one
board
?
"

well
-
when
you
pay
over
$
1000
for
something
you
want
it
to
hold
up
and
look
good
!!!

yes
!

i
was
calling
about
one
board
!!

i
'm
very
frustrated
at
this
point
-
it
would
take
all
of
10
min
for
them
to
come
by
and
replace
the
one
board
that
is
cracked
(
the
crack
is
deep
enough
to
stick
a
penny
in
it
and
it
goes
clear
through
)
yet
they
do
not
want
to
take
the
time
to
bother
with
what
once
was
a
happy
customer
and
has
now
become
a
dissatisfied
customer
.

so
i
figure
if
they
do
n't
want
to
take
the
time
to
fix
the
fence
that
they
installed
then
i
'll
take
the
time
to
let
everyone
i
can
know
about
how
they
treat
customers
once
they
have
your
money
!!!

stay
away
!!!

you
get
what
you
pay
for
!!!

they
came
in
under
a
lot
of
other
quotes
and
now
i
know
why
!!!

when
the
fence
was
first
installed
i
would
have
given
them
five
stars
,
now
for
their
poor
customer
follow
-
up
and
unwillingness
to
fix
the
fence
they
have
dropped
to
a
one
-
star
in
my
opinion
!

lots
of
rules
,
phantom
innkeeper
,
last
minute
price
was
worth
it
.

i
called
the
"
207
"
number
and
listened
to
the
same
recording
loop
3
times
before
i
gave
up
.

i
then
called
the
800
number
(
which
was
answered
)
and
inquired
about
last
minute
rates
.

they
had
a
room
with
a
$
99
rate
,
which
i
booked
.

the
room
was
supposed
to
be
on
the
2nd
floor
,
but
they
put
us
on
the
3rd
.

the
email
confirmation
(
which
i
read
in
the
car
)
warned
about
large
suitcases
,
declaring
that
we
are
innkeepers
,
not
longshoreman
.

in
other
words
,
they
do
not
help
with
suitcases
,
but
they
promise
totes
to
help
.

however
upon
our
arrival
no
one
there
(
the
inn
was
open
)
.

so
no
totes
.

finally
a
chambermaid
stuck
her
head
around
the
corner
from
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
told
us
sternly
that
we
could
not
be
accommodated
until
3
m
,
no
exceptions
.

then
she
was
gone
.

we
returned
after
3
pm
,
found
no
one
there
,
and
a
note
from
the
innkeeper
with
directions
to
our
room
.

i
would
n't

quit
with
the
overstatements
!

the
worst
thing
that
can
happen
for
any
restaurant
like
zahav
is
to
have
too
many
people
write
hyperbolic
reviews
making
claims
that
"
everyone
"
is
going
to
"
love
"
the
food
,
decor
and
service
.

the
truth
is
,
in
my
and
my
dining
partners
'
experience
,
this
is
a
fine
little
restaurant
with
some
unique
food
.

it
's
an
entirely
up
and
down
experience
,
however
.

now
,
the
best
of
that
unique
food
comes
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
meal
.

the
salatim
salads
are
the
smallest
plates
i
've
ever
seen
placed
in
front
of
me
(
you
would
most
likely
think
they
were
condiments
if
it
were
n't
explained
to
you
)
.

though
they
are
mostly
excellent
,
you
generally
do
n't
get
enough
forkfuls
to
know
if
you
really
love
them
.

that
being
said
,
the
laffa
and
hummus
are
out
of
this
world
.

then
again
,
for
the
three
of
us
who
dined
together
,
two
pieces
of
flatbread
left
us
fighting
for
more
,
and
licking
the
hummus
from
our
fingers
(
and
yes
,
those
two
pieces
of
flatbread
did
represent
a
three
-
person
order
)
.

dinner
was
also
an
up
-
and
-
down
experience
.

the
vegetarian
dishes
and
lighter
fare
were
almost
always
spot
-
on
,
while
the
lamb
was
often
dry
and
/
or
overcooked
.

the
duck
was
a
65
%
glob
of
chewy
fat
with
no
resemblance
to
the
juicy
,
crispy
delicacy
it
usually
represents
at
other
establishments
.

dessert
was
...
hmmm
,
that
's
interesting
,
i
do
n't
even
remember
dessert
.

i
guess
that
tells
you
a
lot
.

oh
,
yes
,
the
chocolate
semifreddo
was
quite
good
.

the
warm
chocolate
cake
was
very
tasty
,
but
served
at
room
temperature
,
not
warm
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
.

and
my
--
no
,
i
still
do
n't
remember
what
i
had
.

service
was
average
,
but
nothing
special
,
and
restaurants
that
are
supposed
to
be
excellent
should
do
a
better
job
of
training
their
waitstaff
to
be
communicative
and
friendly
,
not
merely
capable
.

perhaps
had
we
not
gone
into
this
restaurant
believing
zahav
was
going
to
be
golden
as
its
name
suggests
(
and
as
the
many
golden
reviews
seem
to
attest
)
,
we
would
have
enjoyed
a
decent
little
expensive
experience
.

but
one
should
not
go
here
expecting
something
fantastic
,
unless
perhaps
you
've
never
had
middle
-
eastern
food
before
,
or
succulent
duck
,
tasty
lamb
,
decent
portion
sizes
or
actually
warm
chocolate
desserts
.

ps
)
when
we
called
for
a
reservation
,
we
were
told
that
5:00
and
9:30
were
their
only
openings
.

when
we
arrived
at
5
,
and
left
circa
7
,
there
were
the
same
4
or
5
empty
tables
surrounding
us
.

did
they
think
we
were
going
to
feel
lucky
to
get
any
reservation
at
all
,
and
therefore
be
more
pleased
with
our
dining
experience
?

must
read
-
do
not
waste
your
time
in
this
store
.

at
my
appointment
the
girl
helping
me
was
unable
to
adequately
lace
up
some
of
the
dresses
.

they
felt
like
they
were
going
to
fall
off
of
me
and
it
was
very
difficult
to
see
what
i
would
actually
look
like
were
i
to
purchase
some
of
these
dresses
.

i
thought
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
see
how
a
few
that
i
liked
would
look
like
on
a
model
(
by
looking
the
dress
up
online
)
.

so
,
as
i
was
leaving
i
asked
for
the
designer
/
dress
name
or
style
number
associated
with
my
top
picks
.

they
said
they
were
"
unable
to
tell
me
until
they
ordered
my
dress
"
.

hmmm
...
a
person
can
not
call
a
company
,
if
you
have
no
idea
its
name
(
since
the
designer
is
unknown
...
supposedly
)
,
and
order
a
gown
without
a
dress
name
or
style
number
.

do
other
brides
fall
for
this
???

they
either
:
a
)
do
n't
want
to
give
it
to
me
because
they
do
n't
want
me
purchasing
the
dress
elsewhere
or
b
)
are
recreating
the
dresses
themselves
(
ie
stealing
other
designers
'
dress
designs
and
"
filling
the
orders
"
by
their
own
seamstresses
)
.

i
'm
no
detective
but
...
uhh
...
seriously
?!?

whatever
type
of
operation
they
are
running
,
i
'm
not
interested
and
if
you
're
smart
,
you
wo
n't
be
either
.

what
a
waste
of
time
.

aside
from
that
little
*
mystery
*
,
one
of
the
sales
ladies
was
quite
comfortable
telling
me
how
wrong
i
was
about
how
another
dress
that
i
loved
compared
to
one
of
her
dresses
that
i
was
trying
on
.

somehow
,
since
she
supposedly
does
n't
know
any
names
of
designers
/
dresses
,
after
i
told
her
the
designer
and
dress
name
of
the
one
i
was
comparing
,
she
knew
"
exactly
which
dress
"
i
was
referring
to
and
disagreed
with
my
observation
;
she
said
that
the
bodice
did
come
as
low
as
the
one
i
had
on
.

my
point
:
even
if
i
was
wrong
,
do
n't
sit
there
and
argue
with
the
customer
.

say
something
like
,
"
huh
.

i
did
n't
think
so
but
you
could
be
right
.
"

unless
you
want
to
take
the
"
tell
the
customer
how
wrong
she
is
and
try
and
force
her
into
a
dress
she
's
obviously
not
loving
"
approach
which
will
likely
get
you
...
uh
...
nowhere
.

seriously
:
do
not
waste
your
time
.

other
shops
around
this
city
have
much
nicer
and
more
transparent
owners
.

not
owners
that
seem
like
they
have
something
to
hide
and
know
nothing
about
common
courtesy
and
customer
service
.

i
felt
very
much
like
wedding
gallery
was
being
dishonest
and
i
would
n't
trust
them
to
lace
me
up
in
another
gown
let
alone
trust
them
with
the
gown
i
will
wear
on
the
most
important
day
of
my
life
.

awful
service
!

after
happily
visiting
sear's
automotives
in
the
past
,
i
was
shocked
at
the
horrible
service
received
at
their
greensboro
location
.

i
brought
my
car
in
on
a
sunday
to
replace
a
shredded
tire
.

i
waited
about
20
minutes
in
the
store
part
before
anyone
was
able
to
assist
me
and
was
then
told
to
pull
my
car
into
the
shop
(
that
is
apparently
what
you
are
supposed
to
do
,
but
the
big
signs
pointing
you
that
way
are
for
some
reason
kept
inside
the
garage
,
so
you
do
n't
see
them
drving
up
,
and
they
purposely
block
the
front
pull
-
up
that
all
other
sear's
use
)
.

once
inside
,
i
had
to
stand
around
for
at
least
10
more
minutes
before
--
finally
--
a
technician
got
to
me
.

once
i
returned
to
pick
up
my
car
,
you
can
believe
i
spent
quite
a
bit
more
time
standing
around
waiting
.

i
had
wanted
to
split
the
total
between
a
credit
card
and
check
card
since
i
was
being
reimbursed
for
the
tire
but
was
told
this
was
n't
possible
.

once
i
actually
got
back
in
my
car
,
it
was
dirty
and
had
grease
all
over
the
steering
wheel
.

ok
,
one
bad
experience
...
fine
.

the
following
friday
,
i
returned
with
my
car
to
go
ahead
and
replace
the
other
3
tires
,
which
were
worn
.

i
would
not
have
gone
back
,
but
i
could
n't
find
the
particular
tire
they
'd
used
in
stock
anywhere
else
.

once
again
,
i
waited
for
quite
a
bit
before
being
attended
to
.

i
got
the
order
completed
,
and
then
questioned
the
technician
since
it
came
out
about
$
40
less
than
i
expected
.

he
said
it
was
the
same
tire
,
and
verified
this
,
after
checking
both
the
actual
tire
on
my
car
and
my
service
papers
from
earlier
in
the
week
.

however
,
when
he
printed
out
the
service
quote
,
i
could
see
that
it
was
not
the
correct
tire
,
and
was
not
even
an
appropriate
tire
for
my
car
model
.

so
i
pointed
this
out
to
him
,
at
which
point
he
said
they
only
had
one
of
the
correct
tires
in
stock
.

ok
--
fine
.

so
i
got
just
my
other
rear
tire
replaced
.

they
promised
it
'd
be
done
within
an
hour
,
so
i
waited
in
the
lobby
.

over
two
hours
later
(
and
ten
minutes
before
they
closed
)
my
car
was
finally
finished
.

a
few
minutes
after
i
left
,
i
was
called
and
informed
that
"
i
"
left
my
wheel
lock
(
which
they
should
have
left
in
the
car
)
.

of
course
,
they
would
be
closing
in
5
minutes
,
so
i
would
have
to
hurry
up
or
get
it
the
next
day
.

of
course
i
could
n't
make
it
back
in
time
(
and
they
apparently
could
not
stay
5
extra
minutes
to
wait
for
me
)
.

the
next
day
,
no
one
could
find
my
wheel
lock
and
that
particular
technician
was
not
in
.

of
course
,
they
could
n't
call
him
either
to
ask
about
it
because
apparently
they
do
n't
keep
their
employees
'
phone
numbers
(
riiight
)
,
so
i
would
have
to
return
on
monday
(
driving
for
3
days
now
with
no
wheel
lock
should
i
get
a
flat
)
.

on
monday
i
called
and
again
it
was
a
big
to
-
do
to
find
anyone
who
knew
anything
about
it
.

supposedly
they
will
be
holding
it
for
me
this
evening
,
but
i
'm
sure
that
will
also
be
a
huge
ordeal
.

the
employees
at
this
sear's
are
completely
apathetic
and
there
did
n't
seem
to
be
any
sort
of
management
that
i
could
see
.

i
will
never
return
there
again
(
and
now
have
some
serious
doubts
about
the
quality
of
work
they
actually
performed
on
my
car
)
.
the
dude
who
grills
the
retarded
dogs
is
rude
.

if
this
is
the
best
that
tucson
has
to
offer
,
i
am
out
ta
here
...

i
called
on
a
friday
at
12:30
complaining
of
a
severe
toothache
.

dr.
obina
told
me
that
his
office
closed
at
noon
and
that
i
should
call
him
on
monday
.

i
had
been
a
patient
of
dr.
olbina
for
9
years
and
had
spent
thousands
of
dollars
on
crowns
etc
.

there
are
plenty
of
good
dentists
in
fernandina
.

do
n't
go
to
amelia
gentle
dentistry
.

good
location

for
a
hotel
like
this
you
would
expect
some
form
of
free
internet
.

what
you
get
is
a
$
13
/
day
charge
to
access
the
internet
through
a
slow
512
/
512
kb
/
s
that
you
can
only
use
to
check
email
etc
(
read
:
no
downloading
)
.

other
than
that
the
hotel
is
in
a
good
location
and
the
breakfast
is
great

make
you
feel
like
a
number

stay
away
from
kids
first
west
chester
.

you
never
get
a
human
on
the
phone
.

it
's
impossible
to
get
an
appointment
.

if
you
get
caught
in
traffic
and
are
a
couple
minutes
late
they
make
you
re-schedule
...
for
6
weeks
later
.

and
worst
of
all
your
child
feels
like
a
number
not
a
patient
.

go
somewhere
else
.

november

,
2010
first
time
eating
at
caffe
bella
italia
and
it
was
a
wonderful
experience
.

from
the
delectable
antipasto
misto
to
the
spaghetti
alla
barese
and
the
parmigiana
and
ending
with
gelato
,
all
was
mouth
watering
.

too
bad
they
were
out
of
the
chocolate
lava
cake
.

maybe
next
time
they
will
have
it
.

service
was
excellent
!

sandy

beware
of
sharayu

hopless
service
,
at
the
time
of
booking
my
car
a
lot
was
promised
but
delivered
not
even
one
tenth
of
what
was
promised
.

apart
from
that
in
spite
of
my
repeated
attempts
i
could
not
get
in
touch
with
the
manager
to
even
lodge
an
official
complaint
.

my
advise
to
all
is
i
have
fallen
into
this
trap
...
pl
ensure
you
do
nt
!!!

course
has
come
a
long
way
!!

hcc
's
new
nine
was
a
little
shaky
at
first
,
but
the
new
grounds
superintendant
has
done
wonders
for
the
course
!!

the
comment
below
definitely
needs
to
be
retracted
!

come
back
and
give
hcc
a
second
chance
at
least
!

it
is
a
great
course
for
local
golfers
to
be
proud
of
and
all
the
comments
in
2008
have
been
very
positive
!!

excellent
physiotherapists
!

kusal
goonewardena
and
his
team
of
physios
are
unbelievable
!

i
have
been
suffering
from
back
pain
for
over
12
years
and
have
been
to
numerous
specialists
,
physios
,
osteos
and
chiros
with
no
help
.

it
took
the
vigor
team
only
4
visits
to
get
me
feeling
normal
!

and
now
2
months
after
my
last
appointment
i
am
better
than
ever
.

thanks
guys
!

they
must
have
read
these
reviews
and
improved
!

my
husband
and
i
happened
in
on
a
whim
.

we
sat
in
the
front
dining
area
,
it
was
very
cozy
and
pleasant
.

our
server
was
quite
attentive
and
the
food
was
fantastic
.

my
husband
has
been
a
professional
chef
,
so
he
is
a
good
judge
of
quality
food
.

this
was
a
flavorful
,
enjoyable
meal
for
both
of
us
.

rude
rude
rude

went
in
there
and
got
my
dog
groomed
came
home
to
an
uneven
dog
then
took
him
back
to
get
evened
up
what
a
mistake
!

she
did
nt
even
let
me
finish
a
sentence
without
insulting
me
and
telling
me
how
i
should
have
said
it
!

i
wo
nt
go
back
!

she
needs
to
develop
a
personality
!

brought
dog
home
and
it
s
all
choppy
now
!

it
's
helpful
to
know
a
quite
a
bit
about
bull
fighting
.

if
you
watch
a
lot
of
fights
(
youtube
)
and
research
some
of
the
history
(
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bullfighting
)
you
will
find
yourself
enjoying
it
a
lot
more
!

also
after
seeing
a
handful
of
bullfights
,
i
can
say
that
they
're
a
lot
more
enjoyable
if
you
're
smashed
(
bac
>=
.15
)
.

all
i
can
say
is
that
i
am
glad
i
went
in
!

the
nurses
are
sweet
as
pie
and
the
doctor
is
wonderful
.

this
place
is
about
healing
,
not
making
a
buck
.

the
followup
visit
is
free
!!

after
going
to
the
hospital
and
paying
er
prices
...
there
is
no
way
i
wo
n't
be
back
here
!!

i
will
be
back
and
telling
everyone
about
this
clinic
.

thank
you
!!

i
just
like
the
fact
that
he
was
able
to
do
the
specific
type
of
repair
i
wanted
(
a
reball
)
and
give
me
the
longest
warranty
and
even
a
lower
price
.

someone
else
i
found
that
said
they
could
do
it
but
wanted
to
charge
me
more
and
give
me
less
warranty
.

it
was
a
no
brainer
really
.

i
choose
console
pros
and
i
'm
happy
i
did
.

this
place
is
bad
.

it
's
dark
,
dingy
&
dirty
.

the
salads
are
limp
and
the
rest
of
the
food
is
n't
any
better
(
ok
,
the
nachos
are
not
too
bad
!
)

this
place
may
have
been
something
sometime
;
but
it
way
past
it
"
sell
by
date
"
.

i
have
eaten
here
twice
in
the
past
year
and
will
not
go
back
and
can
not
recommend
it
.

ham
s
on
friendly
...
rip

this
is
the
original
ham
's
restaurant
,
expanded
into
a
regional
chain
in
the
late
80's
--
but
this
one
is
no
more
.

victim
of
hard
times
and
i
suspect
failing
corporate
management
.

according
to
news
accounts
,
the
company
is
struggling
.

i
have
many
fond
memories
of
my
college
evenings
there
long
ago
.

so
long
ham
s
...
you
will
be
missed
.

we
are
very
pleased
with
the
services
of
first
glass
window
.

our
window
panes
were
so
dirty
that
they
needed
a
specialist
to
come
and
clean
them
.

we
called
few
companies
before
we
decide
to
hire
them
.

they
came
on
time
and
completed
their
work
quickly
.

we
were
very
happy
how
clean
looked
our
windows
.

if
you
have
some
problems
with
your
windows
,
you
should
call
them
.

great
help
even
near
closing
time
!

i
came
in
to
town
for
a
week
and
forgot
my
trainers
!

oh
no
!!

i
came
in
30
min
before
close
and
the
staff
was
super
helpful
.

they
spent
a
lot
of
time
with
me
and
got
me
into
a
great
pair
of
shoes
.

i
think
they
may
even
be
better
than
the
pair
i
have
been
using
this
past
year
!

thanks
run
on
!

great

this
is
a
perfect
place
to
get
your
hair
done
.

i
have
gone
there
time
and
time
again
whenever
i
need
to
get
my
hair
done
or
when
i
want
a
haircut
.

when
i
get
my
hair
done
there
,
they
use
enough
hairstyling
products
while
it
does
not
ruin
your
hair
.

the
service
is
great
and
during
weekends
it
tends
to
get
busy
,
but
the
wait
is
worthwhile
.

highly
recommend

i
have
worked
with
shannon
as
my
massage
therapist
and
intuitive
bodyworker
for
years
and
have
never
been
disappointed
.

no
matter
what
state
i
am
in
when
i
arrive
,
i
always
leave
feeling
better
.

she
has
not
only
helped
me
through
some
challenging
computer
-
work
and
sports
related
injuries
,
she
was
wonderful
to
work
with
throughout
my
pregnancy
and
beyond
.

i
highly
recommend
her
.

best
store
in
boothbay
harbor

what
a
fantastic
store
,
i
love
this
place
.

not
the
same
old
stuff
that
all
the
other
stores
have
.

their
items
are
very
unique
,
great
quality
,
great
prices
.

they
also
have
the
best
tea
i
ever
had
,
not
at
all
like
the
junk
you
get
at
the
grocery
stores
,
i
stock
up
when
ever
there
because
they
are
closed
in
the
winter
.

the
best

dr.
aster
and
her
team
have
been
a
strong
advocate
in
the
health
of
both
my
daughters
.

dr.
aster
is
very
kind
an
gentle
with
the
children
,
but
also
positive
and
to
the
point
with
the
parents
.

she
is
and
excellent
doctor
to
have
on
one
's
team
.

even
though
i
live
pretty
far
from
her
office
i
still
make
the
trip
so
my
daughters
will
have
the
best
!

my
wife
and
i
avoided
doing
some
fairly
simple
electrical
re-wiring
in
our
home
for
several
years
due
to
overall
hassle
and
cost
involved
.

i
finally
called
matt
from
bonafide
and
he
made
the
project
both
easy
for
us
and
reasonable
.

he
was
prompt
,
knowledgable
,
friendly
,
clean
and
just
an
overall
great
guy
who
obviously
cares
about
his
business
.

i
will
reccommend
his
services
however
/
whenever
possible
!

real
pros

i
've
had
writer
friends
describe
horror
stories
with
their
printers
.

i
tell
them
:
why
not
just
go
with
these
guys
?

richard
joule
and
the
gang
are
pros
from
start
to
finish
.

they
set
out
to
exceed
your
expectations
.

already
i
'm
considering
future
projects
,
and
i
can
assure
you
that
for
my
printing
needs
i
will
be
choosing
no
other
than
atlanta
paperback
book
printing
.

i
have
been
here
3
times
and
all
3
times
it
has
been
bad
!

they
have
messed
up
my
order
and
....
the
food
was
just
not
good
!

i
had
sonic
in
many
other
palces
but
for
some
reason
this
sonic
is
always
just
covered
in
grease
and
not
good
...
:(

i
hope
they
get
there
act
together
...

i
am
going
to
give
it
one
last
chance
in
next
few
months
and
see
??

i
called
them
for
an
estimate
and
they
insulted
me
when
i
ask
them
questions
.

they
are
very
rude
and
nasty
.

please
do
n't
use
this
moving
company
if
you
do
n't
want
to
:
cry
,
have
trouble
and
a
bad
experience
on
the
day
of
your
move
.

they
will
give
you
a
low
price
over
the
phone
and
on
the
day
of
your
move
they
will
change
the
price
,
i
guarantee
it
.

you
've
got
maids
did
a
fabulous
job
cleaning
my
home
.

i
am
hiring
them
to
come
once
a
week
now
that
they
got
my
house
to
where
they
can
maintain
it
for
only
an
hour
and
a
half
every
two
weeks
!

satisfactory
for
sure
with
the
sercvice
!

beats
having
one
"
cleaning
lady
"
who
took
twice
as
long
and
did
not
do
a
very
through
job
like
the
"
maids
"
did
!

this
place
has
the
best
baby
and
children
s
clothes
.

especially
high
end
keep
sake
sort
of
clothing
that
you
just
ca
nt
find
in
a
lot
of
stores
.

it
is
all
very
unique
and
you
wo
nt
find
any
other
baby
wearing
the
same
stuff
.

i
spent
quite
a
bit
because
i
spoil
my
little
princess
.

after
all
she
will
only
be
a
baby
for
so
long
i
figure
why
not
enjoy
it
.

..

we
also
had
the
bbq
spare
ribs
..
good
also
.

i
ordered
the
moo
shu
pork
and
it
was
great
..

i
also
ordered
the
neptune
platter
which
was
awesome
...
so
this
place
gets
5
out
of
5
stars
.

do
not
go
here
!!!

i
went
to
get
my
nails
filled
friday
,
by
monday
2
were
broken
.

i
was
not
happy
with
the
way
they
looked
,
very
wavy
,
uneven
edges
,
and
with
the
exception
of
1
,
there
is
a
dip
in
the
center
of
each
nail
.

i
also
had
a
pedicure
,
and
they
cut
my
nails
too
short
,
one
of
my
big
toes
looks
like
it
s
getting
infected
.

no
way
.

i
'm
certainly
no
expert
on
asian
food
in
fact
not
even
a
lover
of
vietnamese
food
but
i
wanted
to
try
the
real
things
here
at
a
dong
.

cold
,
slimy
,
tasteless
however
is
the
same
in
all
languages
and
foods
.

not
good
,
not
great
,
and
again
another
disappointment
in
central
iowa
.

how
do
these
places
stay
in
business
.

this
town
needs
some
food
soul
and
this
is
not
it
.

worth
every
penny

my
girlfriend
and
i
ate
at
the
grill
last
night
,
and
our
experience
was
amazing
.

everything
we
ordered
was
prepared
to
perfection
,
and
was
presented
perfectly
.

the
asparagus
,
seared
tuna
,
and
lobster
tail
were
the
best
we
ever
had
.

then
the
desserts
came
,
and
they
were
hands
down
the
best
dessert
we
ever
had
.

i
will
sum
it
up
with
,
it
was
worth
every
penny
!

best
chinese
restaurant
ever
!!!

it
was
the
best
chinese
food
i
have
ever
had
.

all
the
food
tasted
excellent
,
and
with
the
new
renovation
of
chairs
and
the
bathroom
,
it
is
awesome
.

the
people
working
their
are
also
extremely
polite
and
friendly
.

every
time
i
go
,
kevin
,
the
manager
,
will
always
remember
my
family
and
i
.

overall
,
it
is
very
family
oriented
,
and
i
recommend
it
to
everyone
!!!

i
had
john

professional
.

john
was
here
in

minutes
after
i
called
on

if
you
need

,
i
definitely
would
call

professional
and
inspiring

nigel
from
nidd
design
has
always
provided
a
first
class
service
,
from
his
advice
and
professionalism
to
the
quality
of
his
design
drawings
and
planning
applications
.

his
knowledge
and
expertise
help
smooth
the
way
with
any
planning
application
,
ensuring
compliance
with
the
building
regulations
.

once
you

nigel
you
will
not
want
to
work
with
anyone
else
.

he
really
does
turn
your
dreams
into
reality
for
your
home
!

we
came
at
around
730
and
they
close
at
8
and
wanted
to
try
the
specials
but
they
were
out
for
the
day
so
i
would
say
go
way
before
they
close
.

got
the
crab
rangoon
which
was
great
,
tofu
with
cabbage
which
was
spicy
but
good
and
shrimp
satay
which
was
also
good
.

def
going
to
come
back
and
try
this
place
again
.

bea
was
really
nice
and
asked
how
the
food
was
.

cute
place
also

as
a
native
southern
californian
i
can
tell
you
that
this
is
not
authentic
mexican
food
.

however
,
i
still
like
this
place
a
lot
.

esp.
the
mole
,
tortilla
soup
,
and
guacamole
.

margaritas
are
alright
.

my
only
complaint
is
the
queso
.

it
used
to
be
fabulous
,
why
did
you
guys
change
it
??

queso
should
not
be
watery
:(
.....

***
update
***
never
mind
!

they
fixed
the
queso
!

at

.

in
fact
my

vomited
after
our

maybe
we
ordered
the
wrong
dish
but
my
experience
here
was
poor
.

service
was
okay
not
great
,
we
came
for
a
late

i
do

small
firm
with
great
service

bloom
legal
was
really
attentive
to
my
problem
,
and
seth
bloom
took
the
time
to
help
me
understand
the
legal
issue
i
was
dealing
with
.

i
much
preferred
the
one
-
on
-
one
service
here
to
the
experiences
i
've
had
with
bigger
offices
and
firms
.

while
i
hope
i
do
n't
have
any
need
for
a
lawyer
anytime
soon
,
if
i
do
i
'll
definitely
use
this
firm
again
.

used
their
service
for
the
first
time
and
was
immediately
impressed
by
their
professionalism
(
received
a
phone
call
soon
after
order
was
placed
to
confirm
details
)
and
the
subsequent
delivery
of
my
gift
(
to
split
,
croatia
)
was
as
requested
.

the
gift
itself
was
exactly
as
described
and
pictured
in
the
catalogue
and
of
the
highest
standard
.

would
highly
recommend
to
anyone

fitness

a

to
a
lot
of

members
who
work
out
daily

the
best
place
to
be

how

over-rated
...

this
restaurant
is
over-rated
.

it
is
hard
to
find
...
and
the
mexican
food
is
bland
,
almost
equivalent
to
eating
out
of
a
can
.

the
service
is
poor
...

i
asked
for
a
fried
egg
on
my
enchiladas
...
and
did
not
get
it
.!

secondly
,
the
enchladas
did
not
come
with
enchilada
sauce
..
but
chili
...
like
hormel
's
chili
..
the
cheese
was
american
cheese
!

the
chili
relleno
..
had
no
batter
on
it
.

i
googled
restaurants
in
the
area
and
fuji
sushi
came
up
and
reviews
were
great
so
i
made
a
carry
out
order
of
:
l
17
.

mixed
tempura
.....................
8.25
shrimp
or
vegetable
tempura
&
salad
.

i
was
very
happy
with
the
customer
service
and
even
more
please
with
the
portion
size
,
to
go
box
set
up
and
quality
of
the
food
for
the
price
.

i
'm
very
happy
and
will
definitely
dine
in
and
carry
out
again
.

good
pizza
at
a
good
price

i
just
moved
nearby
and
have
tried
several
of
the
local
places
,
this
was
the
first
one
and
i
should
have
just
stuck
with
it
.

the
pizza
is
usually
pretty
good
,
the
only
bad
one
we
got
was
on
a
friday
night
and
it
just
needed
to
be
cooked
a
little
more
,
but
it
was
still
good
.

their
bbq
chicken
pizza
is
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
ever
had
.

horrible
service
!!!

absolute
horrible
service
from
the
parts
department
.

they
are
very
rude
over
the
phone
and
in
person
.

they
talk
down
to
you
like
they
are
supreme
beings
,
if
you
hate
your
job
so
much
then
quit
!!

how
these
guys
can
get
away
with
being
so
rude
with
people
is
mind
blowing
.

i
will
never
do
business
with
sun
toyota
again
.

thank
god
there
are
plenty
of
toyota
dealerships
to
choose
from
in
this
city
.

this
is
a
good
place

i
have
been
here
before
and
the
service
was
absoulutely
great
.

they
had
a
great
selection
of
colors
to
choose
from
and
their
seats
are
super
comfty
.

i
enjoy
going
there
although
i
've
only
been
there
once
,
i
will
be
returning
toda
to
recieve
a
pair
of
french
tips
and
i
will
only
go
to
the
best
and
to
me
the
best
is
here
.

i
reccomend
you
to
go
and
enjoy
their
wonderful
hospitality
.

anna
marie
and
govind
are
very
sweet
people
,
and
the
minute
you
steep
into
their
school
,
the
calm
loving
atmosphere
takes
over
,
and
tension
and
worries
stay
outside
in
the
street
,
whether
or
not
you
pick
them
up
again
after
class
is
probably
a
question
of
practice
.

a
wonderful
place
,
if
you
want
more
than
just
the
physical
side
of
yoga
.

give
yourself
the
gift
of
trying
this
place
,
to
see
if
it
fits
you
...

they
do
n't
seem
to
be
interested
in
selling
cars
.

went
there
yesterday
:
we
are
trying
to
decide
between
two
different
honda
models
,
so
we
wanted
to
test
-
drive
both
back
to
back
.

the
salesperson
refused
!

claimed
he
was
too
busy
for
two
test
drives
.

we
were
the
only
customers
there
!

do
n't
waste
time
,
just
drive
10
minutes
more
down
to
stevens
creek
,
they
actually
do
try
to
help
their
customers
there
!

ate
here
a
couple
times
.

it
is
not
a
high
end
steak
house
,
more
of
the
cuisine
brett
enjoys
in
mississippi
.

so
,
if
you
want
a
burger
and
fries
,
well
,
it
is
ok
.

if
you
want
a
little
cajunish
food
-
it
is
good
.

if
you
want
a
steak
,
well
,
this
is
not
the
best
in
green
bay
.

overall
decent
but
if
you
are
expecting
a
ruth
chris
type
steak
,
this
is
not
it
.

eulogic

good
place
to
be
on
a
sunday
night
.

the
beers
were
good
,
nice
choice
of
beers
as
well
,
and
as
usual
the
mussels
were
great
,
the
place
upstairs
is
a
nice
addition
to
the
bar
downstairs
.

filled
up
on
too
much
beer
and
hence
can
not
comment
on
the
food
.

but
the
menu
had
standard
stuff
that
one
would
get
at
a
belgian
tavern
.

if
you
are
a
handcraft
beer
person
,
this
is
a
fantastic
place
to
be
.

perfect
location
plus

i
moved
into
the
tanglewood
apartments
in
late
2008
and
it
's
been
a
refreshing
change
.

i
used
to
live
at
meadowrun
and
that
was
a
nightmare
.

the
manager
-
tiffany
-
is
actually
very
nice
so
i
'm
a
bit
surprised
by
other
comments
.

she
's
very
reachable
and
she
has
always
responded
quickly
to
any
questions
or
requests
.

plus
she
plans
a
monthly
breakfasts
and
other
events
at
the
clubhouse
which
is
a
nice
added
benefit
.

great
service
/
deals
-
support
this
local
business

i
have
used
these
guys
for
new
snows
,
fixing
lots
of
flats
,
used
replacement
tires
,
and
oil
changes
.

they
have
the
best
prices
locally
and
good
customer
service
.

one
guy
is
a
little
surley
,
but
who
gives
a
crap
as
long
as
your
car
's
work
is
outstanding
.

and
they
're
usually
able
to
help
you
as
a
walk
-
in
,
and
they
're
fast
.

overall
-
good
stuff
.

another
great
business
bites
the
dust
!

the
best
cakes
ever
!

a
bit
pricey
,
so
i
did
n't
go
very
often
,
but
it
was
always
a
treat
when
i
did
.

the
prices
were
worth
what
i
got
.

i
'm
assuming
they
are
completely
out
of
business
since
i
ca
n't
find
any
contact
information
.

i
'm
hoping
the
bakers
continue
to
do
their
baking
out
of
another
place
,
because
it
would
be
a
shame
not
to
have
these
cakes
any
longer
.

super
nice
people
,
really
good
food

what
i
love
most
about
this
place
,
other
than
the
food
,
is
that
eating
here
makes
you
feel
like
you
're
in
a
small
town
rather
than
baltimore
.

the
owners
are
really
nice
,
they
serve
good
food
at
a
good
price
,
and
the
option
to
eat
outside
on
the
deck
(
esp
on
the
weekend
whether
there
is
hardly
any
traffic
)
is
great
.

one
of
my
top
5
places
to
eat
in
baltimore
.

overpriced

this
place
is
identical
to
the
youngstown
sports
grille
,
so
i
imagine
they
are
owned
/
operated
by
the
same
people
.

the
food
is
mediocre
at
best
,
and
largely
overpriced
given
the
portion
size
and
quality
.

do
n't
even
get
me
started
on
how
expensive
it
is
to
drink
there
.

i
have
ate
here
3
times
since
they
first
opened
,
and
the
service
has
been
poor
each
time
,
the
staff
always
comes
across
as
somewhat
rude
and
slow
.

enjoyed
this
cozy
little
spot
with
a
group
of
8
folks
.

service
was
excellent
.

food
was
excellent
.

wine
was

i
was
feeling
the
need
for
some
fish
so
i
had
the
salmon
which
was
very
good
but
the
steaks
looked
amazing
and
if
i
am
in
town
again
,
i
'll
definitely
order
a
steak
.

a
perfect
place
for
a
romantic
dinner
.

lots
of
"
pretty

"
dining
inside
.

great
staff
.

very
helpful
!!!!

they
interviewed
me
,
gave
me
tests
in
the
software
i
included
on
my
resume
,
and
placed
me
in
a
position
that
i
kept
for
several
years
.

re-interviewed
and
am
going
on
interviews
for
a
new

i

really
thankful
for
the
folks
at
hr
office
.

they
are
dependable
,
have
great
connections
in
the
community
,
and
are
a
great
resource
for
finding
a
job
.

i
highly
recommend
them
to
all
of
my
friends
!!!!
!

great
experience
-
consider
checking
out
their
puppies
before
buying
from
a
breeder
!

i
adopted
a
3.5
month
old
yellow
lab
last
winter
from
the
dumb
friends
league
.

the
staff
was
very
helpful
in
finding
the
right
dog
for
me
and
the
care
my
pup
received
was
outstanding
.

if
you
are
on
the
lookout
for
a
pure
breed
pup
do
n't
forget
to
check
out
the
shelters
!

my
pup
has
a
wonderful
temperment
and
has
been
a
wonderful
addition
to
my
family
!

food
good
,
service
poor

no
silverware
,
asked
for
a
spoon
for
my
son
s
mac
and
cheese
ended
up
having
to
use
my
tea
spoon
.

asked
for
bar
-
b
-
que
sauce
never
got
it
.

never
checked
back
with
us
once
we
got
our
food
.

had
to
go
the
the
bus
boy
s
station
ourselves
to
get
napkins
.

only
one
server
,
too
buys
talking
with
others
i
guess
.

food
was
good
,
but
service
means
a
lot
to
me
.

dr.
chao
you
are
the
best
dentist
i
have
ever
had
.

you
are
knowledgeable
,
professional
,
gentel
and
kind
.

i
wish
i
had
you
as
my
dentist
early
on
in
my
life
-
maybe
my
teeth
would
have
been
a
lot
better
then
they
are
now
,
however
i
am
glad
you
are
my
dentist
now
.

even
though
you
are
expensive
.

thank
you
for
helping
to
preserve
my
teeth
.

you
are
meticulous
in
your
work
and
it
shows
in
my
smile
.

con
garage

i
brought
my
car
in
for
a
simple
emissions
test
.

i
guess
they
figured
me
for
an
easy
mark
,
and
tried
to
explain
that
my
car
would
n't
pass
unless
i
replaced
a
hose
.

ten
minutes
later
,
i
took
my
car
down
the
street
and
it
passed
the
emissions
test
with
flying
colors
.

if
you
're
a
fan
of
herpes
,
being
ripped
off
,
and
child
molesters
,
this
is
the
garage
for
you
.

if
not
,
go
somewhere
else
.

rude
service

even
though
i
have
never
tried
hoa
salon
but
i
agree
with
other
reviewers
that
they
are
rude
.

i
called
and
asked
about
the
price
for
hair
updo
and
the
receptionist
or
owner
who
aswered
the
phone
refused
to
tell
me
,
or
even
just
give
me
an
approximate
price
range
.

he
told
us
to
stop
by
the
salon
and
then
he
will
tell
us
the
price
.

what
kind
of
rude
service
is
that
?

i
do
n't
want
to
waste
my
time
with
them
.

top
notch
eats
!

so
here
we
are
in
manson
.

manson
?

yes
,
manson
.

right
near
chelan
.

aka
nowheresville
.

and
this
litttle
gem
of
a
7
-
table
restaurant
is
a
complete
and
utterly
wonderful
surprise
.

a
short
but
wide
-
ranging
menu
executed
with
innovative
perfection
in
a
cozy
hole
in
the
wall
just
off
the
main
street
.

fantastic
food
served
without
pretense
,
very
reasonably
priced
wine
selections
.

a
great
place
to
go
for
dinner
after
a
day
of
wine
tasting
.

excellent
service
and
reasonable
prices

boutique
stores
dealing
in
children
's
clothing
/
gifts
are
often
outrageously
priced
(
who
wants
to
pay
40
dollars
for
a
newborn
onesie
?
)

but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
that
the
purple
goose
's
prices
are
reasonable
(
for
the
same
products
found
at
other
area
boutiques
,
the
prices
were
20
-
25
%
cheaper
)
.

the
service
was
also
excellent
-
friendly
,
helpful
and
informative
without
being
overbearing
.

will
definitely
return
.

consistantly
poor

a
lack
of
organisation
,
coupled
with
the
distain
for
its
customers
,
makes
this
the
worst
rental
agency
i
have
used
.

chasing
them
on
issues
from
the
day
i
moved
in
(
many
of
them
still
unresolved
as
i
left
)
to
all
sorts
of
farcical
issues
with
funds
,
after
i
left
.
.
.
.
as
soon
as
i
could
.

if
you
must
use
them
,
be
vigilant
and
be
ready
to
push
,
if
you
can
go
elsewhere
then
i
would
.

amazing
night
-
great
party
spot
!!

went
to
the
willow
lounge
this
past
weekend
for
dinner
and
drinks
...
place
is
awesome
.

had
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
a
/
c
broke
,
i
feel
bad
it
was
their
opening
!

anyway
,
once
that
is
fixed
,
this
place
will
be
amazing
.

drinks
were
awesome
,
prices
reasonable
,
and
staff
friendly
.

this
is
an
awesome
date
spot
that
the
area
seriously
needs
.

check
out
the
willow
lounge
,
you
ll
be
happy
!

it
s
been
a
few
years
since
i
have
been
to
ipanema
.

but
my
wife
and
i
first
went
there
thinking
it
would
be
brazilian
food
(
think
lots
of
meat
)
,
but
it
turned
out
to
be
a
vegan
restaurant
!

and
,
i
can
say
,
this
was
one
of
my
favorite
places
to
eat
in
all
of
richmond
.

amazing
!

do
n't
let
the
nondescript
building
entrance
fool
you
,
these
are
some
creative
and
talented
chefs
...
two
thumbs
way
,
way
up
!

excellent
food
,
fantastic
wait
staff

i
recently
threw
a
surprise
birthday
party
for
my
wife
at
fraiser
's
.

we
had
30
guests
for
the
event
,
and
everyone
came
away
from
the
evening
impressed
with
not
only
the
food
,
but
the
outstanding
service
as
well
.

the
management
was
easy
to
deal
with
during
the
planning
stages
,
and
the
execution
by
the
kitchen
and
wait
staff
was
flawless
.

i
highly
recommend
fraiser
's
for
anyone
planning
a
special
event
for
friends
,
family
or
business
.

fantastic
store
!!!

i
came
upon
this
store
as
the
building
caught
my
eye
.

it
's
located
in
the
huge
honka
log
homes
building
,
by
walmart
off
of
evergreen
parkway
.

the
store
was
decorated
with
furnishings
&
accessories
.

the
friendly
crew
working
was
great
&
very
helpful
.

this
store
is
what
colorado
is
all
about
.

also
,
i
purchased
some
furniture
last
year
and
all
has
been
great
!

it's
durability
&
look
was
perfect
and
i
will
definitely
be
adding
to
my
collection
soon
!

lovely
people
,
great
hats

i
was
saddened
to
see
the
reviews
that
claimed
world
hats
mart
has
poor
service
.

it
led
me
to
believe
that
the
reviewers
simply
had
difficulty
tolerating
people
with
strongly
-
accented
english
.

the
husband
and
wife
who
run
this
spot
are
lovely
people
.

we
have
had
many
conversations
with
them
and
they
have
always
been
extremely
patient
with
me
as
i
tried
on
multiple
hats
in
search
of
the
right
costumes
for
my
magic
act
.

i
recommend
them
highly
!

do
nt
ever
go
there
,
not
even
if
your
car
flips
.

their
service
sucks
to
start
off
with
,
people
are
cruel
and
ignorant
.

i
'm
compeltly
dissatisfied
with
their
service
and
their
products
.

they
do
not
have
a
return
policy
and
even
if
their
product
sucks
,
they
will
not
take
it
back
!

do
not
ever
go
here
.

i
prefer
advanced
auto
parts
over
this
crappy
place
with
the
meanest
people
.

and
they
thrive
to
get
a
customer
.

do
not
go
here
..
thank
you

horrible

i
have
been
growing
my
hair
out
for
1
year
plus
and
went
in
to
get
1
inch
taken
off
.

i
walked
out
with
5
inch
long
hair
on
the
top
,
2
inch
long
hair
on
the
sides
,
and
1.5
in
the
back
.

my
hair
is
uneven
and
it
looks
rediculous
.

this
woman
should
be
working
in
supercuts
...
if
that
.

this
was
a
terrible
experience
and
i
hope
that
no
one
else
goes
through
that
.

do
your
self
a
favor
and
do
not
go
to
this
establishment
.

the
worst
burger
king
restaurant
!!!

i
generally
like
the
bk
over
the
other
fast
serving
restaurants
;
however
,
i
regreted
to
visit
this
restaurant
at
my
town
.

this
is
a
shame
of
my
adorable
town
,
branford
.

i
ordered
a
kid
meal
with
a
milk
and
found
a
bottle
was
half
opened
already
.

i
asked
them
to
change
it
but
they
rudely
said
that
it
was
okay
.

disgusting
french
fries
is
very
best
menu
.

do
n't
go
,
or
you
will
learn
how
to
waste
your
money
.

disappointed

the
bad
:
i
was
at
napa
recently
and
was
unpleasantly
surprised
at
poor
waiter
svce
and
subpar
food
.

we
were
a
party
of
4
and
none
of
us
were
particularly
pleased
with
our
dishes
.

napa
is
all
about
wine
but
gives
very
short
descriptions
of
the
wines
on
their
lists
.

i
found
my
initial
selection
satisfactory
but
the
wine
flight
we
chose
to
be
poorly
composed
.

if
you
must
go
ask
lots
of
questions
about
your
selections
since
your
expectations
may
as
high
as
mine
were
.

highly
recommended

we
walked
in
to
pick
our
little
man
at
10
minutes
to
closing
and
heard
laughter
from
kids
and
the
staff
.

the
facilities
are
more
than
adequate
and
the
staff
are
just
phenomenal
.

their
sense
of
humour
and
calmness
when
dealing
with
the
little
ones
amazes
me
every
time
i
walk
in
.

we
have
since
moved
slightly
further
away
from
the
centre
but
it
's
worth
the
extra
travel
,
as
the
care
provided
exceeds
our
expectations
...
especially
after
a
few
horrendous
daycare
experiences
elsewhere
.

horrible
!!!!
!

this
has
to
be
some
of
the
worst
pizza
i
have
ever
had
the
misfortune
of
ordering
.

the
crust
was
lopsided
,
thicker
on
one
side
than
the
other
.

it
actually
had
a
hole
in
one
of
the
slices
.

there
was
minimal
cheese
and
sauce
and
it
completely
lacked
flavor
.

i
know
new
york
pizza
and
this
is
not
it
!!

this
was
nothing
like
new
york
style
pizza
!!!.

i
love
pizza
and
this
was
a
complete
and
utter
disappointment
!!

i
would
not
suggest
this
pizza
to
anyone
!!!

best
quote
ever
my
gate
was
stuck
halfway
open
so
i
called
a
class
garage
doors
dr
services
.

they
came
to
my
house
in
no
time
and
started
working
on
the
gate
.

they
were
very
friendly
and
were
able
to
explain
me
exactly
what
was
wrong
with
it
.

once
they
fixed
it
they
answetred
all
of
my
questions
with
no
hesitations
and
then
gave
me
the
best
quote
ever
.

i
know
that
if
my
garage
door
needs
to
be
repaired
,
i
will
be
calling
a
class
garage
doors

you
will
be
happy
at
this
store
!

allen
tire
was
recommended
by
friend
after
my
having
bad
tire
experiences
in
temecula
.

the
store
manager
,
jim
smith
,
made
an
excellent
tire
recommendation
for
my
newly
acquired
lexus
.

tires
were
the
right
price
and
now
the
car
feels
like
it
is
riding
on
rails
around
turns
.

the
store
is
clean
,
run
very
professionally
and
a
pleasure
to
be
in
.

they
know
their
job
and
you
do
not
have
to
watch
them
to
be
sure
everything
is
done
right
.

easiest
time
i
ever
had
purchasing
a
car
!

excellent
service
,
not
only
did
they
get
the
exact
car
i
wanted
win
in
48
hours
but
the
sales
man
also
took
me
out
to
lunch
.

very
kind
and
reliable
.

i
highly
recommend
this
dealership
if
you
would
not
like
to
hassle
on
price
and
receive
friendly
service
.

i
have
since
purchased
two
cars
from
this
dealership
,
the
first
one
was
from
phillip
and
the
second
was
from
richard
.

both
were
excellent
sales
men
who
put
my
needs
first
.

this
place
has
done
a
great
job
of
taking
care
of
the
usual
maintenance
on
my
hooptie
.

i
also
never
have
to
wait
long
for
a
yearly
inspection
sticker
...
and
never
get
the
usual
excuses
other
shops
always
gave
me
...
"
the
inspection
guy
is
n't
here
today
"
....
for
example
.

today
i
went
into
kwik
kar
and
there
were
two
cars
in
front
of
me
for
inspection
...
but
i
was
still
out
of
there
pretty
quick
...
barely
had
time
to
read
a
chapter
in
my
book
.

extremely
helpful
and
professional

as
first
-
time
home
buyers
,
my
husband
and
i
found
stephanie
fairchild
at
prudential
steamboat
realty
,
extremely
helpful
.

she
worked
with
us
for
over
a
year
,
helping
us
find
our
perfect
home
.

stephanie
's
knowledge
of
the
market
and
properties
in
our
price
range
,
made
us
feel
secure
in
our
decision
to
buy
when
we
did
.

we
would
highly
recommend
stephanie
to
anyone
looking
for
a
home
in
the
yampa
valley
.

we
appreciated
her
patience
,
knowledge
and
kindness
!

great
barber

firstly
,
the
other
reviewer
clearly
has
never
been
to
nick
's
,
or
he
would
know
that
nick
only
charges
$
13
for
a
haircut
which
is
pretty
much
industry
standard
.

i
have
been
going
to
nick
for
5
months
now
precisely
because
he
does
pay
attention
to
detail
.

i
have
terrible
hair
and
he
really
takes
his
time
to
make
it
look
right
.

some
of
the
younger
kids
that
work
there
are
a
bit
sub
par
,
but
if
you
wait
for
nick
...
you
'll
be
good
.

ugh
!!!

got
some
nice
"
freshly
baked
"
fruit
squares
,
a
personal
favorite
of
mine
.

took
a
bite
,
it
tasted
odd
.

flipped
the
square
over
and
saw
it
riddled
with
green
mold
!!!!

ugh
!!

i
called
the
store
and
the
clerk
giggled
,
and
agreed
that
it
was
gross
,
but
said
it
was
not
her
problem
.

she
also
refused
to
get
a
manager
.

i
left
my
number
,
or
tried
to
anyway
.

same
clerk
had
considerable
difficulty
taking
down
a
number
.

i
'll
never
go
back
there
again

for
cheap
chinese
food
,
this
is
the
place
to
go
.

i
used
to
eat
at
places
like
new
china
or
green
buffet
in
troy
,
mo
-
nothing
terrible
but
not
that
great
.

now
,
i
wo
n't
eat
fast
food
chinese
unless
it
's
from
this
place
.

the
best
value
i
've
found
from
a
chinese
restaurant
.

i
do
n't
live
in
lake
st.
louis
anymore
,
but
deliveries
were
always
correct
and
the
service
courteous
.

now
i
have
to
be
in
the
area
to
get
some
lovin'
:
sad
face
:

amazing
experience
!

my
experience
was
amazing
at
providence
aesthetics
and
medical
spa
.

jana
kueck
was
nothing
but
professional
.

she
makes
you
feel
like
you
are
the
most
important
person
in
the
world
.

jana
made
me
feel
very
comfortable
.

provided
me
with
warm
blanket
and
has
soft
music
playing
.

walking
in
the
door
you
are
made
to
feel
happy
and
relaxed
.

equipment
is
state
of
the
art
.

i
would
reccomend
anyone
to
go
see
jana
kueck
and
robin
talley
to
see
all
the
many
procedures
they
have
to
offer
.

dave
is
a
patient
and
methodical
teacher
,
who
has
a
great
ear
and
sensitivity
for
his
students
'
passion
and
the
direction
they
want
their
lessons
to
take
.

also
,
he
loves
teaching
so
much
,
his
price
is
unbeatable
,

that
does
not
change
his
level
of
skill

dave
has
much
to
offer
.

in

focused

i
'm
already
now
capable
of

we
love
our
new
roof
!

we
would
like
to
thank
you
for
the
roofing
job
you
did
on
our
home
.

everything
was
done
on
a
timely
manner
and
things
were
cleaned
and
picked
up
every
day
when
the
crew
was
done
.

we
also
liked
the
way
that
ray
checked
on
the
job
every
day
.

and
when
the
job
was
done
every
thing
was
cleaned
up
and
hauled
off
that
same
day
.

we
would
not
hesitate
to
use
spears
roofing
again
.

we
have
already
recommended
you
to
some
of
our
friends
!

omfg

i
fucking
hate
this
place
every
time
i
go
this
hot
chick
shows
up
and
i
mean
really
hot
but
she
is
like
reaaaally
dumb
and
then
their
is
this
other
chick
that
is
realy
ugly
but
she
is
like
super
smart
she
could
be
a
scientist
,
but
then
their
is
this
stoner
who
always
comes
here
high
and
he
always
brings
his
fucking
dog
who
is
so
high
from
the
second
hand
smoke
i
think
he
is
trying
to
talk
.

anyway
we
drive
around
in
my
van
and
solve
mysterys
and
shit

amazingly
yummy
!

i
just
got
back
from
france
yesterday
and
just
missed
the
food
already
!

my
sister
in
law
told
me
about
this
amazing
new
crepe
place
in
town
,
i
was
so
excited
i
just
wanted
to
go
and
test
it
out
for
my
self
!

their
customer
service
was
perfect
!

their
food
was
better
then
anything
i
had
ever
tasted
.

even
in
france
!

i
would
highly
recommend
this
place
to
anyone
looking
for
a
great
atmosphere
,
amazing
food
,
and
great
customer
service
!

thank
you
roll
up
crepes
!

this
is
one
of
the
worst
places
i
have
stayed
,
we
cut
out
stay
short
and
went
to
the
mulberry
.

even
though
they
still
charge
you
the
days
you
booked
but
wo
n't
use
,
it
is
worth
the
get
the
hell
out
of
this
crap
hole
.

the
whole
experience
shows
a
hotel
managed
by
what
must
be
a
2
star
hotel
manager
.

bad
service
starting
from
the
front
desk
.

the
best
person
is
the
valet
.

short
of
that
,
avoid
this
place
,
as
a
silver
marriott
member
,
this
is
a
disgrace
.

best
place
in
ames

i
lived
here
for
two
years
when
the
prices
were
a
little
lower
:)
the
places
are
very
nice
and
clean
,
and
in
great
condition
!

i
really
enjoyed
the
staff
at
wessex
,
also
the
manager
sherri
was
always
very
nice
and
helpful
.

the
fitness
center
was
great
!

the
only
problem
that
i
had
in
2
years
of
living
there
was
that
the
walls
are
pretty
thin
,
sometimes
i
could
here
my
neighbors
conversations
.

i
would
recommend
these
apartments
to
anybody
!

i
absolutely
loved
living
there
.

the
best
service
ever
!!

i
have
never
had
better
service
.

my
car
broke
down
and
roadside
towed
my
vehicle
to
sussman
kia
.

they
squeezed
me
in
and
had
me
back
up
and
running
in
no
time
.

everyone
was
pleasant
and
very
helpful
.

the
service
department
even
gave
me
a
ride
home
and
picked
me
up
when
my
car
was
finished
.

the
advisor
kept
me
up
to
date
and
informed
on
the
progress
of
my
vehicle
.

i
give
this
dealer
an
a
+
!

i
will
definitely
be
bringing
my
car
back
for
service
.

heaven
on
earthhhhhhh
!!!!

must
try
!!!

a
+++

this
place
is
the
best
.

i
hated
sushi
before
but
now
i
ca
nt
stop
eatting
it

nice
service
,
and
excellent
food
.

everything
in
here
seems
to
amaze
me
!!!

their
grill
dishes

this
world
and
sushi

!!!!

a
week
.

excellent
sushi

friendly
,
fine
food

the
one
-
star
review
from
2005
is
out
of
date
.

there
was
a
change
of
ownership
a
couple
of
years
ago
and
service
is
both
quick
and
extremely
friendly
.

the
food
continues
to
be
very
good
--
deli
sandwiches
,
homemade
soups
,
fresh
salads
.

the
atmosphere
may
not
be
for
everyone
.

it
is
a
bustling
place
where
separate
parties
are
seated
at
the
same
table
(
as
in
many
european
cafes
)
,
but
if
you
are
ok
with
that
,
the
food
is
very
good
.

love
the
soups
.

the
new
italian
kid
on
the
block

another
italian
restaurant
in
collingswood
?

do
we
need
another
one
?

only
if
it
is
of
the
quality
of
that
's
amore
.

the
menu
has
the
usual
but
then
they
step
it
up
another
notch
.

the
arancini
di
riso
(
risotto
fritters
)
are
not
to
be
missed
.

chicken
saltimboca
was
excellent
and
then
there
's
the
chocolate
mousse
that
comes
straight
from
heaven
.

pay
extra
attention
to
the
appetizers
-
the
next
time
i
go
there
i
'm
planning
on
ordered
a
few
instead
of
an
entree
.

auto
towing
is
one
of
the
best
towing
services
i
have
used
.

the
first
time
i
used
them
they
arrived
on
time
and
towed
car
for
me
to
the
destination
i
needed
.

the
auto
mechanics
that
work
for
auto
towing
are
very
friendly
and
informative
and
answered
any
question
i
had
.

they
have
towed
car
for
me
a
few
times
and
i
am
always
very
satisfied
with
this
services
.

if
you
are
looking
for
towing
services
that
can
offer
you
a
good
towed
car
service
,
then
auto
towing
is
the
company
for
you
.

a
very
satisfied
new
customer
!

as
a
very
satisfied
new
customer
,
i
wholeheartedly
recommend
united
air
duct
cleaning
.

they
are
professional
,
knowledgeable
,
and
take
meticulous
care
and
pride
in
accomplishing
their
work
.

not
only
were
my
wife
and
i
very
pleased
,
but
i
also
had
the
air
duct
quality
tested
professionally
by
the
home
inspector
that
i
regularly
use
,
before
and
after
united
air
duct
performed
their
work
.

based
on
the
test
results
,
the
home
inspector
stated
that
the
quality
of
their
job
was
"
excellent
"
.

the
best
breakfast
in
solana
beach
!

we
love
t
's
cafe
!

without
a
doubt
the
best
place
to
grab
a
tall
bloody
mary
and
some
eggs
benedict
.

t
's
has
been
a
north
county
landmark
for
thirty
years
and
with
good
reason
.

family
owned
and
operated
makes
sure
the
atmosphere
is
relaxed
and
the
food
home
-
cooked
with
style
.

i
highly
recommend
picking
up
a
jug
of
their
homemade
bloody
mary
mix
-
definitely
the
best
.

if
you
've
been
to
north
county
,
chances
are
it
's
in
your
favorites
list
already
.

prominent
builders
nj

prominent
builders
in
new
jersey
are
one
the
best
building
contractors
,
i
was
referred
to
them
by
my
friend
,
i
am
so
glad
i
used
them
for
my
home
renovation
,
and
addition
.

they
were
very
professional
,
respectful
,
completed
the
job
on
time
,
and
well
below
my
budget
.

mike
one
of
owners
was
awesome
,
he
explained
the
detailed
plan
,
and
executed
on
time
,
i
am
always
going
use
them
and
refer
them
to
many
friends
i
can
because
of
the
great
job
they
did
me
.

great
dude
cut
!

great
service
,
cool
vibe
,
impeccable
style
.

i
'm
a
guy
with
tricky
hair
so
getting
that
right
is
job
1
.

after
going
through
5
other
places
i
finally
found
janice
at
alta
moda
.

not
only
was
it
a
good
cut
but
my
wife
and
friends
comment
on
my
hair
every
time
i
leave
...
saying
it
's
the
best
look
i
've
ever
had
.

either
i
suck
at
my
own
style
or
janice
is
a
genius
.

looks
like
there
's
a
lot
of
talent
in
this
place
.

worth
every
penny
.

my
favorite
place
at
wildwood

i
have
been
going
to
the
wildwood
,
nj
for
over
30
years
for
summer
vacations
and
always
call
the
madrid
first
.

i
rated
it
5
stars
.

i
am
not
saying
it
is
a
5
star
hotel
.

i
am
saying
when
comparing
all
other
hotels
in
wildwood
,
this
hotel
has
everything
that
we
are
looking
for
.

it
is
the
hospitality
from
tom
and
staff
,
that
makes
it
feel
like
a
5
star
hotel
in
the
middle
of
the
beach
.

we
prefer
the
layout
of
rooms
and
it
is
always
clean
.

when
in
scordia
,
sicily

if
ever
in
sicily
please
take
the
time
to
visit
anna
maria
jose
mudo
and
her
familia
.

they
are
and
always
will
be
the
nicest
people
in
sicily
that
you
will
meet
.

you
will
also
have
the
pleasure
of
learning
the
italiano
language
.

you
will
also
have
the
experience
of
learning
the
bella
sicilian
culture
,
that
i
have
fallen
in
luv
with
.

i
will
4
-
ever
be
eternally
grateful
for
their
hospitality
and
luv
that
my
sicilian
family
showed
me
when
i
was
there
for
3
years
.

luv
always
..

i
've
never
felt
the
need
to
write
a
review
or
make
a
complaint
before
,
but
after
the
way
i
was
spoken
to
by
a
member
of
staff
at
the
kennels
(
whose
name
i
believe
to
be
mrs
closs
)
i
would
now
not
recommend
this
business
to
anybody
.

if
the
animals
are
treated
in
the
same
way
the
customers
are
treated
then
this
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
!

nobody
should
be
spoken
to
like
that
regardless
of
how
bad
their
day
may
have
been
or
what
may
be
going
on
in
their
private
lives
!

best
car
dealer
in
tx

i
purchased
a
nissan
from
this
dealship
.

the
sales
men
were
very
knowledgeable
about
every
aspect
of
every
car
we
looked
at
.

they
were
very
patient
and
helpful
from
showing
the
cars
to
doing
the
paperwork
.

the
paperwork
was
a
very
easy
and
smooth
.

they
tried
to
run
my
credit
score
as
less
as
possible
so
it
wo
n't
hurt
my
score
.

overall
,
i
was
very
happy
with
the
customer
service
and
my
purchase
.

if
you
're
looking
to
buy
a
car
,
definitely
give
them
a
call
.

they
have
a
huge
inventory
.

i
have
been
a
patient
a
nw
hospital
and
it
was
great
.

i
have
also
had
an
80
yr
old
that
i
take
of
sent
to
the
er
and
long
stays
in
the
hospital
.

yes
,
we
had
to
wait
,
but
er
is
a
triage
system
that
takes
the
most
life
threatening
cases
first
.

any
er
would
be
the
same
.

as
far
as
being
treated
like
a
drug
seeker
,
that
has
not
been
my
experience
.

as
a
nurse
i
know
about
drug
seekers
.

this
is
a
great
hospital
and
even
better
since
it
became
part
of
the
uw
system
.

wonderful
experience

i
had
immense
pain
on
a
sunday
morning
,
with
friends
and
family
telling
me
that
i
would
never
find
a
dentist
on
a
sunday
.

dr.
taylor
was
not
only
available
on
a
sunday
,
but
also
was
able
to
immediately
take
care
of
me
.

he
was
incredibly
informative
about
the
options
i
had
,
giving
me
opinions
on
different
treatments
to
choose
from
.

coming
from
a
person
who
hates
the
dentist
in
general
,
dr.
taylor
was
the
best
!

he
really
made
the
visit
a
pain
free
one
with
excellent
service
!

i
would
recommend
him
to
everyone
!

horrible

this
school
is
the
worst
one
i
've
ever
been
to
.

i
attended
it
for
2
years
,
and
that
was
enough
.

there
's
holes
everywhere
in
the
ceiling
,
sewage
constantly
leaks
through
the
ceiling
,
and
the
whole
condition
of
the
school
is
horrible
.

the
staff
and
the
principal
are
rediculous
,
they
do
n't
listen
to
any
input
,
and
they
make
up
rediculous
rules
(
they
banned
backpacks
,
because
a
teacher
tripped
over
a
student
's
)
.

the
education
is
horrible
at
best
,
do
society
a
favor
,
and
do
not
send
your
student
here
.

excellent
customer
service
and
quality
work
.

they
went
the
extra
mile
to
repair
my
cowboy
boots
--
they
had
to
have
a
special
kind
of
paper
that
looked
like
wood
grain
to
fix
the
heels
.

that
was
4
years
ago
.

i
have
n't
been
able
to
find
a
shoe
repair
place
in
seattle
since
that
has
been
able
to
do
it
.

(
i
've
been
through
at
least
5
places
already
.
)

if
i
had
time
to
drive
to
tacoma
before
they
closed
during
the
work
week
,
i
would
just
so
i
could
get
those
boots
fixed
properly
again
.

so
handy
for
local
la
jolla
stuff
-
especially
for
finding
residential
numbers

since
moving
back
from
college
and
trying
to
settle
roots
in
the
village
,
i
have
referred
to
the
la
jolla
blue
book
for
a
ton
of
local
numbers
.

the
white
pages
allowed
me
to
get
in
touch
with
parents
of
my
high
school
friends
so
that
i
could
track
people
down
one
by
one
and
the
restaurant
section
is
basically
my
cookbook
.

it
's
really
cool
that
so
many
local
businesses
are
found
so
quickly
in
one
place
and
i
want
to
spread
the
word
.

thx
:-)

the
staff
do
occasionally
get
game
info
correct
,
but
if
you
r
looking
fot
a
good
game
and
are
n't
a
nerd
,
do
nt
ask
them
.

the
last
time
i
did
that
i
was
suggested
to
buy
oblivion
when
i
told
them
i
was
looking
for
a
fps
.

i
knew
what
it
was
and
told
the
guy
that
it
was
n't
a
fps
.

he
tried
to
tell
me
it
was
when
i
told
asked
him
if
he
knew
what
fps
stood
for
and
he
had
no
clue
.

overall
they
are
n't
very
knowledge
about
the
type
of
games
are
on
the
market
.

first
and
last
time
we
'll
eat
there

my
friend
and
i
went
there
for
lunch
today
.

neither
one
of
us
had
ever
been
-
so
we
thought
we
'd
try
it
.

big
mistake
-
the
food
was
tasteless
and
cold
.

we
both
kept
trying
to
find
something
we
liked
.

the
only
thing
i
found
edible
were
the
potato
wedges
,
i
finally
gave
up
,
he
kept
trying
-
he
found
the
fried
wantons
to
be
ok
-
his
mongolian
bowl
was
awful
.

would
not
recommend
this
place
to
anyone
-
in
fact
-
save
your
money
and
go
somewhere
else
.

liquidweb.com
rocks
!!!

i
am
not
a
client
of
liquidweb.com
,
but
one
of
my
friend
called
steven
is
the
client
having
several
websites
.

i
work
with
him
and
since
past
6
years
he
is
hosting
his
websites
to
liquidweb
.

as
i
have
gone
through
many
reviews
sites
to
see
if
any
provider
is
providing
better
services
or
not
,
and
i
have
realized
that
there
were
many
good
reviews
about
liquidweb
also
steven
never
faced

simple
but
perfect

if
you
want
flashy
fancy
food
stacked
high
with
lots
of
fussy
garnishes
,
this
is
not
the
place
for
you
.

if
you
want
perfectly
executed
simple
dishes
that
feature
a
few
exquisite
ingredients
,
you
'll
love

hands
-
down
the
best
pasta
and
gnocchi
i
've
ever
eaten
(
and
i
've
eaten
a
lot
)
.

the
antipasti
were
amazing
,
the
wines
were
mind
-
blowing
,
the
service
could
n't
have
been
better
.

i
've
dined
at
lots
of
high
-
end
restaurants
and
i
've
never
before
felt
my
money
was
so
well
spent
.

great
prices
,
great
service
!

i
've
been
to
this
shop
twice
(
once
for
an
inspection
and
again
for
an
oil
change
)
and
they
truly
live
up
to
their
name
:
discount
!

they
have
all
kind
of
coupons
available
for
car
washes
,
oil
changes
,
state
inspection
,
etc
.

the
thing
is
,
you
still
get
high
quality
service
at
nicely
discounted
rates
!

there
is
even
free
coffee
and
bottles
of
water
if
you
'd
like
.

the
owner
is
a
pleasant
guy
and
i
would
trust
my
car
with
him
or
any
of
his
workers
.

top
notch
,
all
the
way
!

david
is
amazing

david
is
the
most
helpful
and
creative
photographer
that
i
have
used
.

he
is
willing
to
do
whatever
you
need
from
him
without
hesitation
.

he
was
patient
and
adapted
when
everything
did
n't
go
according
to
schedule
on
my
wedding
day
.

both
the
engagement
and
wedding
pictures
that
he
took
for
us
we
absolutely
amazing
.

he
got
the
pictures
back
to
me
quickly
.

i
would
highly
recommend
david
to
anyone
.

he
will
exceed
your
expectations
!

he
does
n't
just
take
pictures
he
makes
art
out
of
them
and
you
wo
n't
even
notice
that
there
's
a
camera
there
.

not
so
great

my
husband
just
got
a
bike
there
as
a
gift
he
's
only
had
it
a
month
.

it
's
a
nice
bike
and
it
cost
a
lot
of
money
.

but
just
this
week
a
peddle
broke
.

he
took
it
back
and
they
would
not
honor
a
warranty
and
said
it
was
his
fault
because
of
his
shoes
??

so
they
were
going
to
charge
him
for
new
peddles
and
proceeded
to
put
them
on
without
even
telling
him
the
price
.

which
was
very
expensive
.

he
asked
for
a
different
pair
instead
and
they
only
gave
him
five
dollars
off
??

trek
is
not
so
great

only
concerned
with
money

i
have
been
getting
my
treatments
for
a
few
months
now
and
have
seen
some
results
but
not
up
to
the
standards
that
i
was
told
i
should
expect
.

the
people
there
attempt
to
come
across
and
professional
and
nice
,
but
i
was
disappointed
with
their
customer
service
.

never
miss
an
appointment
because
they
will
charge
you
the
price
of
a
treatment
,
even
if
you
had
an
emergency
.

it
's
pretty
ridiculous
!

they
want
to
squeeze
as
much
as
they
can
from
you
even
if
you
just
got
in
a
car
accident
!!!!

they
do
n't
care
one
bit
about
you
!!!!!

terrible
service
!!!

made
an
appointment
to
have
them
come
to
the
house
to
discuss
curtain
options
and
give
an
estimate
.

they
sent
over
someone
who
said
he
knows
nothing
about
curtains
and
could
not
show
me
fabric
options
or
give
an
estimate
.

when
i
called
the
manager
to
complain
,
she
said
she
knew
the
guy
did
n't
know
about
curtains
and
that
the
usual
lady
called
in
sick
hours
earlier
!

instead
of
rescheduling
they
chose
to
waste
my
time
instead
.

so
what
was
the
point
of
the
appointment
!?!

to
just
come
over
and
hang
out
?!?

i
will
never
do
business
with
this
company
!

ever
!!!

internet
department
is
rude
and
insulting

i
was
looking
to
bring
a
customer
to
their
lot
to
buy
a
car
but
the
internet
salesperson
last
name
is
balazick
sent
me
this
email
"
and
if
it
was
worth
my
time
i
would
of
bothered
aswering
your
questions
.

i
make
money
not
deal
with
brokers
"
wow
,
can
you
believe
in
today
s
tough
times
this
dealership
would
be
looking
for
any
way
to
move
vehicles
.

as
a
previous
internet
manager
i
would
deal
with
anyone
looking
to
buy
a
car
for
a
profit
and
not
care
if
they
came
in
with
a
broker
.

stay
away
from
this
dealership
!!!

this
place
is
a
rip
-
off

i
brought
a
car
in
to
have
the
"
check
engine
"
light
diagnosed
back
in
march
of
2010
.

they
said
it
was
"
plugs
and
wires
"
and
quoted
me
$
330
to
do
the
work
,
including
parts
.

i
asked
why
so
high
and
they
said
it
was
due
to
the
labor
of
moving
things
out
of
the
way
.

those
things
ended
up
being
a
windsheild
washer
fluid
tank
(
1
screw
)
and
the
air
filter
canister
(
4
spring
clips
)
.

i
did
the
work
myself
for
$
50
.

there
's
no
excuse
for
that
kind
of
estimate
.

my
girlfriend
and
i
took
a
chance
on
this
place
because
we
did
n't
want
to
wait
in
line
at
outback
.

what
an
amazing
find
-
this
restaurant
is
a
gem
.

1
it
s
immaculately
clean
.

2
the
decor
is
tasteful
and
artistic
,
from
the
comfortable
chairs
to
the
elegant
light
fixtures
....
and
(
most
importantly
)
3
the
food
is
fantastic
.

this
is
authentic
cuban
cuisine
;
fresh
ingredients
expertly
prepared
and
seasoned
perfectly
.

the
portions
were
generous
and
we
got
out
for
less
than
the
cost
of
one
entree
at
some
chain
restaurant
.

try
this
place
-
you
'll
love
it
.

thank
you
for
helping
me
get
more
healthy
!

i
came
in
and
saw
dr.
ruona
about
a
month
ago
for
quitting
smoking
.

i
have
to
tell
you
that
i
have
n't
had
one
and
do
n't
want
one
.

it
is
the
easiest
thing
that
i
have
ever
done
and
i
tell
all
my
friends
that
they
should
do
it
too
.

i
sent
a
customer
of
mine
to
you
.

dr.
ruona
,
if
you
read
this
,
thank
you
for
helping
me
get
more
healthy
.

i
feel
lighter
and
feel
that
i
have
more
possibilities
open
to
me
now
than
i
did
before
.

i
ca
n't
thank
you
enough
.

fantastic
for
kids

if
you
have
children
or
are
just
a
real
animal
lover
yourself
you
'll
love
this
zoo
.

it
's
only
$
10
and
in
essence
just
one
big
petting
zoo
.

they
sell
feed
and
milk
bottles
at
the
front
and
i
recommend
you
buy
lots
.

we
took
our
7
month
old
and
she
laughed
and
giggled
when
(
very
harshly
i
might
add
)
grabbing
and
'
kissed
'
the
goats
and
lambs
.

the
animals
were
all
very
sweet
and
patient
with
her
.

among
the
animals
that
were
available
to
touch
were
pony's
,
camels
and
even
an
ostrich
!!!

wonderful
,
inexpensive
and
lots
of
fun
!

wow
!!!

i
ca
n't
say
enough
good
things
about
karla
and
the
wonderful
things
she
has
done
for
me
and
my
dog
gracee
.

gracee
is
more
excited
to
see
her
than
she
is
to
see
me
!!!!

she
has
always
been
there
for
gracee
even
for
last
minute
calls
!

she
has
taken
care
of
my
sweet
girl
for
almost
4
years
now
and
i
would
not
let
gracee
go
with
anyone
besides
her
!!!

she
is
caring
,
punctual
,
and
very
enthusiastic
about
her
job
!

you
should
give
her
a
try
-
it
's
worth
every
penny
to
know
that
you
pet
is
in
great
hands
with
wunderbar
pet
sitting
!!!!

worst
service
i
've
ever
experienced

i
wish
there
was
something
good
to
say
about
the
business
,
but
unfortunately
,
there
is
n't
.

1
)
service
and
manners
were
nonexistent
.

2
)
the
employees
constantly
talk
down
to
customers
and
are
very
argumentative
for
the
sake
of
being
argumentative
.

(
to
both
myself
and
customers
)
3
)
i
have
never
experienced
so
much
rudeness
coming
from
a
business
.

4
)
the
business
is
very
unorganized
.

the
invoice
is
not
detailed
,
so
it
is
difficult
to
see
what
you
are
paying
for
.

i
'd
recommend
to
save
your
time
and
energy
and
find
another
greek
store
.

exile
is
the
best
!!!

exile
is
the
longest
lasting
and
most
authentic
punk
store
in
richmond
!

i
have
been
shopping
there
for
over
six
years
now
.

the
staff
is
incredibly
friendly
and
helpful
and
the
owner
,
mimmy
,
is
an
absolute
angel
.

the
mark
up
is
minimal
considering
that
the
clothing
is
hard
to
find
and
often
shipped
for
europe
.

in
addition
,
the
clothing
is
of
much
better
quality
than
the
clothing
from
hot
topic
,
which
is
made
as
cheaply
as
possible
by
people
living
in
horrible
conditions
in
asia
.

exile
is
environmentally
conscious
and
involved
heavily
in
our
community
.

over-rated

buddakan
inevitably
attracts
the
majority
of
its
guests
simply
because
of
its
association
with
steven
starr
,
but
that
does
n't
impress
me
.

the
atmosphere
alone
deserves
4
stars
but
,
the
food
was
not
up
to
par
with
the
price
tag
and
the
reputation
the
restaurant
carries
.

the
server
we
had
was
knowledgeable
but
he
was
not
as
proper
as
he
should
have
been
,
acting
like
he
was
talking
to
his
friends
rather
than
his
customers
.

the
angry
lobster
was
completely
over-priced
!

$
80
for
a
dish
that
has
about
one
small
lobster
tail
and
is
full
of
filler
vegetables
!

i
would
n't
go
there
again
.

alto
delivers
on
all
levels
.

from
the
moment
you
enter
the
restaurant
,
you
know
you
are
some
place
special
.

the
service
is
impeccable
,
and
the
food
is
even
better
.

i
highly
recommend
the
four
-
course
tasting
menu
,
which
gives
you
plenty
of
range
and
food
to
satisfy
your
appetite
.

also
,
if
you
are
into
wine
,
alto
has
the
depth
of
both
region
,
varietal
,
and
vintage
to
satisfy
nearly
any
sommelier
(
or
after
9
pm
,
bring
your
own
bottle
for
free
...
no
corking
fee
!
)
.

while
it
's
not
cheap
,
alto
will
give
you
an
experience
you
'll
never
forget
.

the
landlord
is
not
nice
nor
helpful

i
have
lived
in
buckingham
condominiums
townhouse
for
2
years
.

i
love
the
location
and
the
apartment
!!

i
'm
a
single
female
and
i
feel
safe
coming
home
at
night
.

the
maintenance
people
are
awesome
!!!!

and
the
exterminator
is
very
nice
,
also
.

yes
,
you
still
have
a
few
bugs
,
but
that
's
going
to
be
anywhere
you
go
!

the
only
problem
that
i
have
experienced
is
the
landlord
.

she
is
a
pure
b****
!!!

i
know
that
's
ugly
...
but
she
wo
n't
help
you
out
for
anything
...
sad
story
.

other
than
that
,
i
would
recommend
living
here
.
:)

the
staff
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
.

the
front
staff
has
seen
quite
a
bit
of
turnover
and
changed
from
professional
to
rude
.

a
simple
follow
-
up
phone
call
with
a
woman
quickly
turned
into
a
nightmare
.

she
may
be
the
reason
for
all
the
change
.

i
sincerely
wonder
if
the
doctor
has
a
clue
about
what
is
going
on
within
his
practice
.

if
he
does
know
and
approves
of
this
behavior
then
it
is
a
poor
reflection
on
him
.

sometimes
it
is
not
worth
it
to
go
through
that
kind
of
staff
and
their
personal
attitude
to
get
to
a
doctor
.

he
was
an
okay
doctor
but
not
worth
her
.

wonderful
wild
wildernest
inn

i
would
give
the
wildernest
inn
ten
stars
of
five
!

atop
spring
mountain
,
from
the
decks
of
the
west
porch
,
"
one
can
see
forever
"
a
scene
of
unparalleled
beauty
and
grandeur
.

i
saw
deer
frequently
,
in
fact
a
small
herd
were
grazing
near
the
lodge
.

there
were
occasional
bears
on
the
deck
in
the
morning
.

and
most
correctly
,
us
visitors
did
not
mingle
with
the
native
wildlife
.

it
would
have
been
more
than
one
could
bear
!

kathy
and
stewart
,
the
proprietors
were
the
epitome
of
perfection
.

delightful
,
hospitable
,
superb
,
cozy
and
comfortable
.

i
hope
to
be
back

junkie
lube
?!

really
weird
place
,
i
was
driving
home
from
work
thought
i
'd
stop
in
for
an
oil
change
and
well
,
there
are
a
few
guys
in
jiffy
lube
uniforms
sitting
at
the
table
drinking
beers
and
shooting
the
breeze
.

the
neon
lighting
sign
still
said
"
on
"
yet
some
guy
who
seemed
to
be
the
oldest
of
the
bunch
,
more
like
the
drunkest
of
the
bunch
told
me
they
'd
be
open
tomorrow
.

i
asked
if
a
manager
was
on
duty
he
told
me
he
was
.

wow
!

grey

"

"
of

a
friend
and
i
recently
took
our
16
and
18
month
olds
here
.

while
there
was
n't
too
much
available
for
their
age
(
ball
pit
,
bouncy
area
and
a
little
padded
pyramid
to
climb
on
)
,
we
went
right
when
they
opened
at
10
am
on
a
winter
weekday
and
ended
up
being
the
only
ones
there
,
so
we
were
given
a
little
more
liberty
than
we
would
have
if
others
had
been
there
.

it
's
not
the
classiest
place
,
but
it
was
cleaner
than
i
expected
and
the
staff
was
very
friendly
.

for
$
4
it
was
a
nice
break
from
the
monotony
of
winter
indoors
with
a
toddler
.

restored
my
faith
in
mechaincs
.

i
spent
3
months
going
from
shop
to
shop
trying
to
get
my
ferrari
to
run
and
drive
the
way
it
should
.

i
was
about
to
give
up
when
i
met
jason
and
neal
.

they
took
on
the
challenge
of
making
my
ferrari
all
i
dreamed
of
and
more
.

the
crew
at
the
creative
workshop
went
over
and
above
the
call
of
duty
and
gave
me
back
a
car
i
can
drive
anywhere
and
finally
enjoy
owning
.

i
can
not
say
enough
about
this
place
.

they
have
restored
my
faith
in
mechanics
.

do
yourself
a
favor
,
call
these
guys
first
and
enjoy
driving
your
car
again
..

a
great
vacation
!

we
wanted
to
see
the
sun
-
and
we
also
got
much
more
!

excellent
chefs
are
in
the
kitchen
preparing
memorable
breakfasts
.

after
a
train
ride
over
the
mountains
,
we
enjoyed
hiking
in
the
flower
-
filled
wenatchee
hills
(
in
may
)
and
a
very
interesting
bike
ride
in
a
loop
around
the
columbia
river
...
and
then
wine
if
we
wanted
it
on
the
patio
in
the
evening
....

this
is
a
busy
group
of
hosts
they
are
also
running
a
restaurant
,
which
also
must
be
wonderful
-
so
just
ask
for
what
you
need
,
and
i
'm
sure
they
will
do
their
best
to
be
hospitable
.

omg

omg
..
make
sure
to
book
a
reservation
,
as
this
magical
place
is
packed
(
in
a
nice
way
)
i
love
that
the
owner
walks
around
and
cares
how
his
customers
feel
about
their
food
.

the
waiters
are
like
no
other
...

my
waiter
was
so
excellent
i
gave
him
a
75
%
tip
,
and
it
was
worht
every
penny
..

the
food
was
finger
licking
the
bowel
fantastic
..

i
just
discovered
her
has
a
place
right
near
my
work
(
color
me
phat
)
if
you
are
looking
for
a
romatic
place
with
the
best
food
and
service
in
the
valley
giovanni
ristorante
should
be
your
number
1
+
2
choice
.

holly
is
truely
the
best
hairstylist
!

i
have
lived
in
the
utc
la
jolla
area
for
many
years
,
and
i
never
new
this
salon
was
here
until
a
friend
reffered
me
to
see
holly
here
.

i
was
very
pleased
with
my
experience
here
.

all
of
the
people
were
friendly
and
welcoming
.

i
got
highlights
,
haircut
,
and
a
blowdry
.

she
did
a
great
job
!

holly
is
very
experienced
and
talented
,
and
i
could
tell
she
new
what
she
was
doing
right
off
the
bat
.

my
hair
looks
amazing
,
and
i
get
compliments
all
the
time
.

i
deffenitly
reccomend
this
salon
and
holly
to
anyone
.

you
will
not
be
disappointed
!!!!!!

outdated
but
not
bad

so
i
really
felt
like
this
place
was
extremely
outdated
especially
since
the
pictures
make
it
look
nice
and
modern
.

it
had
listed
that
there
was
a
hot
breakfast
but
all
this
meant
is
that
they
added
a
waffle
maker
to
the
common
continental
affair
at
most
cheap
hotels
.

the
family
suite
was
basically
two
rooms
with
a
small
opening
between
them
which
worked
great
for
us
because
we
were
two
families
traveling
together
.

if
you
are
in
town
and
need
that
kind
of
space
i
say
stay
here
but
if
you
are
looking
for
a
little
more
upscale
affair
do
n't
let
the
pictures
fool
you
and
book
somewhere
else
.

great
,
and
probably
the
only
west
indian
spot
worth
hitting
up
in
nashville
.

i
was
born
and
raised
in
toronto
,
which
has
a
huge
west
indian
(
trinidadian
,
jamaican
,
etc
)
population
.

so
huge
in
fact
,
that
toronto
slang
is
influenced
by
and
has
jamaican
references
,
and
jamaican
beef
patties
are
staples
in
my
high
school
cafeteria
.

anyway
,
i
was
practically
raised
on
this
stuff
,
and
being
a
connoisseur
of
west
indian
cuisine
,
jamaica
way
is
a
bit
toned
down
to
suit
the
american
palette
.

all
you
have
to
do
to
make
it
authentic
jamaican
food
,
is
add
a
whole
lot
of
pepper
.

a
lot
.

the
finest
christmas
trees
i
've
ever
seen
.

i
felt
like
i
was
in
heaven
when
i
walked
through
the
majestic
fields
of
this
particular
farm
.

the
trees
were
in
magnificent
shape
and
the
variety
was
astounding
.

the
owners
were
entertaining
and
gracious
.

i
especially
liked
the
eco
friendly
atmosphere
and
the
owner
s
love
of
all
animals
.

this
is
one
of
the
best
farms
i
have
ever
been
too
.

i
would
call
it
the
taj
mahal
of
the
east
coast
!

it
put
hair
on
my
chest
and
thanks
to
the
owner
s
advice
i
invested
vanguard
,
got
myself
a
woman
like
jerry
,
and
became
a
republican
.

thanks

pho
-
nomenal
!!

i
have
been
eating
pho
for
almost
my
entire
life
and
i
've
always
gone
to
the
pho
places
in
south
philly
and
off
the
boulevard
and
even
the
other
one
in
chinatown
,
but
when
i
tried
this
pho
place
,
it
blew
the
other
pho
houses
away
!!

all
of
the
pho
places
taste
the
same
to
me
,
so
what
seperates
one
from
the
other
is
the
service
and
the
price
.

the
service
here
is
incredible
compared
to
the
other
places
.

the
only
down
fall
of
this
pho
house
is
the
difficulty
in
finding
parking
in
chinatown
.

remember
to
bring
cash
since
they
do
n't
take
debit
or
credit
.

hope
this
helps
!!

had
a
horrible
experience
with
a
manager
here
,
rachel
mcinnis
,
she
was
rude
,
inconsiderate
and
did
not
do
the
right
thing
for
an
item
that
was
marked
incorrectly
...

i
'm
not
interested
in
shopping
in
a
place
with
people
like
her
...
she
refused
to
sell
me
the
item
at
its
marked
price
even
after
admitting
they
had
made
a
mistake
.

i
normally
do
n't
write
reviews
but
seeing
that
i
considered
dillards
a
distinguished
,
upscale
place
to
shop
,
this
one
wo
n't
be
getting
my
business
,
nor
my
family
's
,
nor
my
co-workers
.

it
's
never
ok
to
let
a
customer
walk
out
unhappy
,
especially
when
they
are
right
.

highly
recommend

i
work
as
a
transformational
life
coach
.

since
this
is
an
alternative
therapy
i
always
refer
clients
to
a
lisenced
therapist
when
i
feel
that
is
appropriate
.

i
found
her
through
a
colleague
one
day
when
one
of
my
clients
was
in
the
midst
of
a
panic
attack
and
needed
professional
help
that
i
am
not
qualified
to
provide
.

little
did
i
know
that
i
would
soon
be
needing
her
help
as
well
!

she
guided
me
through
a
very
difficult
period
dealing
with
a
family
member
's
suicide
,
coupled
with
elder
abuse
.

i
found
her
to
be
extremely
solid
,
kind
,
compassionate
,
and
intuitive
as
well
.

i
would
recommend
her
highly
!

they
wo
n't
have
a
second
chance
from
me
.

first
,
let
me
state
that
although
i
live
in
nyc
,
i
am
not
from
nyc
,
i
do
n't
care
about
baseball
and
i
absolutely
love
boston
to
death
(
so
beautiful
,
so
clean
,
so
awesome
)
.

that
said
,
i
hated
this
restaurant
.

the
service
was
just
about
as
good
as
i
'd
get
in
nyc
(
that
means
it
was
poor
)
and
the
food
was
almost
mediocre
.

the
decor
left
a
lot
to
be
desired
and
the
posters
telling
me
all
the
reasons
99
was
great
just
served
as
an
ironic
contrast
against
the
reality
.

personally
i
recommend
you
take
your
money
elsewhere

when
i
arrived
at
brickell
honda
on
6/4/11
,
i
was
greeted
and
attended
to
by
the
sales
manager
,
gustavo
guerra
,
in
a
very
friendly
and
professional
manner
.

i
explained
to
him
what
i
wanted
and
that
i
previously
went
to
braman
honda
.

bramen
honda
was
a
bit
of
a
hassle
.

he
told
me
"
no
problem
,
we
will
match
the
offer
or
do
better
.
"

mr.
guerra
gave
me
a
better
deal
without
any
hassles
nor
any
type
of
problems
.

brickell
honda
has
been
the
best
buying
experience
in
the
world
.

i
urge
all
st.
thomas
the
apostle
parishioners
and
all
of
south
florida
residents
to
come
see
gus
!!!

excellent
customer
service
!!!

great
,
honest
service

i
took
my
2001
nissan
frontier
in
to
fix
a
cracked
manifold
.

the
dealer
wanted
$
1300
to
fix
that
and
another
$
1500
to
fix
some
other
things
.

eagle
transmission
determined
that
much
of
the
work
the
dealer
said
needed
to
be
done
was
unneccesary
and
what
needed
to
be
fixed
was
only
$
400
!!

i
was
so
impressed
with
the
honesty
and
integrity
of
mike
and
everyone
at
eagle
transmission
!

i
dropped
the
truck
off
in
the
morning
and
it
was
ready
that
afternoon
.

i
have
finally
found
a
mechanic
i
trust
!!

and
it
was
great
that
they
did
not
charge
a
service
fee
to
diagnose
the
problem
-
an
added
bonus
!!

dr.
shady

kelly
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
.

"
dr.
shady
"
is
a
jerk
.

after
the
way
she
spoke
to
me
on
my
last
visit
,
i
will
not
be
returning
!!

good
luck
keeping
business
with
that
stuck
up
attitude
dr.
shady
.

you
have
just
lost
mine
.

the
next
time
you
feel
like
being
condescending
to
someone
,
it
is
not
going
to
be
me
!!!!!!

dr.
shady
is
inexperienced
and
prideful
.

she
probably
does
not
even
have
10
%
of
the
knowledge
that
some
of
the
other
experienced
vets
do
in
this
area
.

i
will
be
carefully
researching
vets
before
i
take
my
dog
someplace
else
.

beautifully
written
reviews
doctor
,
but
completely
untrue
.

poor
experience

i
did
not
have
a
good
experience
w
/
dr.
ghassemlou
.

during
the
session
,
he
demanded
to
have
my
physical
address
,
which
i
've
always
kept
private
as
i
am
enrolled
in
a
witness
protection
program
.

i
believe
he
is
correct
in
that
he
needs
my
physical
address
for
legal
reasons
,
however
,
he
did
not
adequately
explain
this
during
our
session
.

i
learned
more
about
this
doing
my
own
research
afterward
.

i
think
he
could
've
done
more
to
assuage
my
concerns
by
giving
me
concrete
facts
.

saying
that
i
need
to
give
him
my
address
or
else
i
have
intimacy
issues
is
not
helpful
.

it
's
pretty
combative
actually
.

you
'll
love
it

i
have
had
my
back
fused
in
2
places
.

i
wish
that
i
had
n't
done
this
.

with
these
fusions
,
chiropractric
is
n't
as
successful
,
but
it
still
is
very
helpful
.

even
after
my
fusions
,
my
back
continued
to
hurt
,
but
now
it
does
n't
hurt
any
more
.

i
would
encourage
anyone
who
is
thinking
of
back
surgery
,
to
talk
about
different
treatment
options
first
with
dr.
de
barros
.

he
really
knows
what
he
is
talking
about
and
will
approach
the
different
options
fairly
.

you
can
see
different
treatments
that
a
surgeon
ca
n't
see
,
so
that
you
can
have
several
treatment
options
before
you
decide
what
to
do
.

unbelievably
huge
experience
for
such
a
small
salon
!!!

i
have
been
to
kim
at
cheveux
for
more
than
five
years
.

i
can
not
tell
you
how
often
i
am
complimented
on
my
hair
(
style
and
color
)
!

i
regularly
request
kim
's
business
cards
as
i
am
often
stopped
on
the
street
and
asked
"
who
does
your
hair
...
i
love
it
!!!
"

quaint
,
lovely
,
small
salon
with
big
personality
.

i
am
made
to
feel
special
when
i
am
in
the
chair
and
i
have
never
had
a
less
than
amazing
cut
or
color
experience
.

my
hair
has
never
felt
this
healthy
,
either
.

i
can
not
recommend
this
salon
enough
!!!

thanks
cheveux
!

my
favorite
in
mclean

my
family
loves
coming
to
endo
sushi
.
they
are
very
nice
,
it
is
never
crowded
,
and
the
food
is
wonderful
,
very
delicious
and
fresh
!

sometimes
it
is
hard
to
get
parking
in
the
lot
in
front
of
the
storefront
,
and
it
is
on
a
one
-
way
street
,
but
the
restaurant
itself
is
never
overcrowded
.

if
you
can
not
park
in
the
lot
,
then
you
can
park
in
the
shopping
center
's
garage
,
and
walk
up
to
endo
sushi
.

the
service
is
fast
.

be
sure
to
ring
the
little
bell
on
your
way
out
if
you
enjoyed
your
meal
!

(
it
's
by
the
door
,
on
the
hostess
stand
)

horrible
service
!

i
got
yelled
at
,
literally
yelled
at
because
i
asked
if
i
could
pick
up
my
car
5
-
10
minutes
late
.

i
explained
that
i
was
already
on
my
way
and
i
would
rush
to
get
there
as
soon
as
i
could
because
i
needed
my
car
for
work
at
5
am
,
but
the
guy
was
arguing
with
me
saying
he
was
gon
na
lock
the
doors
right
at
5:30
.

rude
,
unprofessional
,
just
jerks
.

seems
like
all
they
care
about
is
the
money
and
getting
home
on
time
,
no
care
for
the
customers
at
all
!!!

missed
a
whole
day
of
work
because
i
am
now
carless
.

i
will
neeeeeeeeeverrrr
go
to
this
place
again
.

superb
arrangements

i
used
fancy
flowers
for
my
late
husband
's
funeral
flowers
as
they
had
been
recommended
to
me
.

i
am
so
glad
that
i
called
in
to
see
ana
,
she
is
a
lovely
girl
who
showed
nothing
but
care
and
compassion
towards
me
.

the
flowers
were
all
that
i
hoped
they
would
be
,
i
have
attended
several
funerals
of
late
unfortunately
and
the
flowers
i
recieved
from
ana
outshone
them
all
.

she
is
so
talented
,
the
flowers
were
arranged
superbly
and
delicately
,
it
is
so
obvious
to
see
the
difference
between
someone
fully
trained
and
skilled
compared
to
others
.

thank
you
ana
i
hope
to
see
you
in
the
future
under
better
circumstances
.

great
first
experience
.

i
'm
22
,
and
my
hairdresser
was
great
(
and
not
"
old
"
like
one
of
the
reviews
says
)
-
she
really
listened
to
what
i
wanted
and
gave
me
tons
of
tips
on
how
to
style
my
hair
so
i
could
get
it
to
look
the
way
i
wanted
it
to
.

she
deep
conditioned
my
hair
and
took
the
time
to
style
it
properly
.

she
recommended
products
but
absolutely
did
n't
pressure
me
to
buy
.

it
's
a
cute
place
with
a
really
friendly
,
laid
-
back
atmosphere
.

i
would
highly
recommend
it
and
will
be
going
back
for
my
next
haircut
.

oh
!

and
students
get
$
5
off
,
ca
n't
argue
with
that
.

smoker
s
haven

yeah
,
this
complex
is
not
very
good
.

our
bathroom
fan
,
one
electric
outlet
and
2
leaky
sinks
have
yet
to
be
fixed
.

both
bathrooms
look
like
they
were
flooded
and
the
wood
cabinets
are
thrashed
at
the
bottom
and
they
slapped
some
pieces
of
wood
over
to
try
to
cover
it
up
.

and
non-smokers
beware
!!!

i
think
90
percent
of
the
tenants
are
smokers
!

if
you
do
not
smoke
,
do
not
move
here
.

our
unit
reeks
of
old
cigarette
smoke
and
it
started
to
become
apparent
a
few
weeks
after
we
moved
in
.

you
can
not
walk
5
feet
without
smelling
that
disgusting
cigarette
smoke
and
it
blows
right
into
the
windows
all
day
and
all
night
.

great
sanwiches
,
great
prices

i
used
to
go
here
almost
every
day
since
i
work
in
the
neighbourhood
and
loved
their
turkey
and
meatball
sandwiches
.

chicken
salad
salad
is
great
too
.

best
of
all
,
the
staff
is
quick
on
their
feet
and
even
with
long
lines
,
usually
serve
you
in
5
minutes
or
less
.

for
the
quality
,
the
prices
(
$
4
-
$
6
)
have
to
be
the
best
in
town
.

the
staff
get
to
know
regulars
and
do
their
job
very
well
.

tourists
like
the
other
reviewer
might
not
appreciate
their
efficiency
or
quality
,
but
i
certainly
do
.

this
is
n't
a
tgif
or
cafe
,
it
s
a
lunch
sandwich
place
and
a
good
one
at
that
.

rate
a
church
?

might
as
well
just
hotpot
the
curb
and
rate
the
traffic
light
.

it
's
a
bloody
church
,
for
chrisssake
!

big
,
grey
and
imposing
.

go
there
on
christian
holidays
for
a
bit
of
churchy
grandure
.

the
pastor
at
this
church
is
cool
,
i
met
him
after
some
holiday
service
.

he
had
a
robe
that
was
made
back
in
the
'60s
.

god
was
pleased
with
that
one
!

it
's
historical
for
sf
,
so
when
your
aunte
comes
for
a
visit
,
take
her
there
.

great
for
the
kiddies
-
they
love
the
labyrinth
(
do
n't
forget
to
tell
'em
it
s
really
a
'
pagen
'
thing
!
)
.

stop
by
at
least
once
or
you
'll
go
to
heck
!

ok
but
just
becuse
we
where
on
a
tight
budget
.

me
and
my
dad
where
in
nj
for
a
kc
chiefs
(
my
home
team
)
vs
the
ny
jets
and
for
game
4
of
the
world
series
.

i
'm
a
red
sox
fan
so
i
was
glad
that
the
phillies
won
.

the
knights
inn
was
small
very
small
.
i
mean
1
room
in
every
room
!
it
was
cozy
a
little
and
a
small
tv
.

i
mean
a
2
day
stay
was
a
ok
stay
even
tho
the
manager
looked
like
he
was
chineze
and
that
we
only
slept
and
went
out
from
8
to
7
to
see
new
york
.

but
sice
we
almost
just
slept
there
i
ca
nt
give
that
good
of
a
review

it
was
a
saturday
and
my
spring
was
broken
...

i
googled
garage
door
repair
in
woodinville
and
found
ndi
-
johnette
answered
the
phone
and
was
oh
-
so
pleasant
and
helpful
!

she
sort
of
appologized
for
dan
taking
the
day
off
to
go
skiing
-
but
he
could
do
the
repair
on
sunday
!

i
said
great
and
dan
arrived
on
time
at
10
am
to
make
the
repair
.

i
enjoyed
speaking
with
dan
,
and
learning
more
about
how
the
springs
are
sized
for
these
doors
.

the
repair
went
quickly
and
the
price
was
extremely
fair
.

i
would
highly
recommend
ndi
-
and
will
spread
the
word
to
my
neighbors
.

thanks
dan
and
johnette
for
your
responsiveness
and
professional
service
.

roger
m.
,
woodinville

i
would
n't
send
my
dogs
there
.

i
had
a
conversation
with
the
woman
running
this
place
in
april
2010
.

she
basically
said
if
the
children
getting
off
the
bus
are
n't
paying
to
enter
her
building
she
was
going
to
let
them
wander
around
the
streets
.

wow
,
really
?

with
all
the
child
predators
out
there
,
a
busy
road
,
cars
speeding
by
......
and
you
are
going
to
let
some
4
/
5
year
olds
wonder
around
cause
you
're
money
hungry
?

real
christian
of
you
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

whether
they
pay
me
or
not
,
if
their
parents
get
into
an
accident
,
stuck
in
traffic
,
etc.
the
last
thing
i
would
do
is
let
a
child
get
raped
because
i
was
n't
paid
.

excellent
service

i
could
easily
go
to
nordstrom
for
my
designer
jeans
and
pay
the
same
price
,
but
i
go
to
the
garment
district
for
their
service
.

previous
reviewers
said
they
were
pushy
and
i
can
understand
that
,
but
i
find
the
staff
more
helpful
than
anything
else
.

tiffany
is
fabulous
!

i
came
in
for
alterations
(
free
,
by
the
way
)
and
told
her
about
a
stain
i
had
on
my
new
leather
purse
.

she
immediately
went
to
the
back
,
brought
out
leather
cleaner
and
cleaned
my
purse
on
the
spot
.

i
did
n't
even
buy
the
bag
there
!

huge
selection
and
,
great
suggestions
from
the
staff
and
they
refer
you
to
reliable
places
if
they
do
n't
have
what
you
need
.

we
were
expecting
a
great
experience
,
when
we
recieved
a
friendly
greeting
by
the
hosts
.

the
atmosphere
was
nice
and
very
clean
.

the
menu
had
plenty
of
options
even
for
picky
eaters
.

the
service
was
ok
,
our
waitress
kept
forgetting
our
drinks
even
though
we
reminded
her
several
times
.

to
start
we
tried
the
guacamole
and
salsa
verde
,
it
was
completly
flavorless
.

we
should
have
left
then
.

we
orderd
our
meals
anyway
,
chimichangas
,
jalapeno
borritos
,
and
quesadillas
.

everything
was
bland
,
completely
void
of
any
spice
or
flavor
.

we
have
never
had
mexican
food
this
bad
,
it
was
just
simply
gross
.

hopefully
they
spice
things
up
or
they
wo
nt
be
in
business
long
.

i
recommend
la
hacienda

might
try
again

pros
:
*
jill
,
the
owner
,
is
very
nice
and
really
cares
about
her
feedback
*
pretty
nice
atmosphere
*
great
dessert
*
not
your
typical
veggie
selection
,
i
like
!

do
n't
know
where
else
you
can
find
purple
hull
peas
and
some
of
the
other
sides
.

cons
:
*
server
was
n't
very
pleasant
*
pretty
small
portion
on
the
blackened
catfish
*
overcooked
food
*
time
,
took
about
25
minutes
from
ordering
to
eating
.

half
the
tables
and
bar
were
empty
by
this
point
.

other
thoughts
:
will
try
this
place
again
.

there
must
be
a
reason
so
many
people
like
it
there
.

their
club
sandwich
looks
tasty
,
maybe
that
'll
change
my
mind
....
and
a
different
server
.

very
professional
/
very
helpful

the
people
at
fidelity
leasing
were
very
friendly
and
helpful
.

i
was
looking
for
a
car
but
did
not
really
know
what
i
wanted
and
they
were
very
helpful
and
took
the
time
to
first
figure
out
what
my
needs
were
and
showing
me
various
options
to
meet
those
needs
.

they
seemed
more
interested
in
helping
me
find
the
right
car
rather
then
just
make
a
sale
.

my
experience
with
them
was
great
-
low
stress
,
very
helpful
and
very
personal
.

after
finding
the
car
i
wanted
they
took
the
time
to
go
over
each
step
and
making
it
as
painless
as
possible
.

from
start
to
finish
they
were
top
notch
.

i
would
highly
recommend
calling
these
people
up
for
your
next
car
.

this
insurance
co.
is
a
joke
!!!

they
have
absolutely
no
communication
skills
whatsoever
.

if
you
do
n't
mind
being
robbed
,
cheated
or
lied
to
then
this
is
the
company
for
you
.

they
will
make
every
attempt
to
misinform
and
misrepresent
themselves
.

they
make
up
excuses
in
hopes
to
confuse
their
policy
holders
with
misinformation
.

as
an
example
they
took
payment
for
5
out
of
6
monthly
plan
premiums
for
a
yearly
policy
and
cancelled
the
contract
for
the
remainder
of
the
policy
for
reasons
they
stated
was
not
receiving
information
on
other
licensed
drivers
in
the
household
?

i
personally
provided
the
request
on
four
separate
occasions
and
they
claim
there
is
a
glitch
in
their
systems
?

ifa
is
an
acronym
for
i
m
a
f%#king
assh@%$e
!!!

fantastic
service
!

i
have
been
here
a
few
times
for
oil
changes
and
just
got
my
tires
,
alignment
and
state
inspection
done
yesterday
.

i
shopped
it
around
and
they
were
extremely
competitive
in
pricing
and
also
added
nitrogen
to
my
tires
which
should
extend
the
life
and
get
me
better
gas
mileage
.

it
also
came
with
free
balance
and
rotation
for
the
life
of
the
tires
!

what
made
it
perfect
was
that
they
offered
transportation
so
that
i
would
not
have
to
wait
there
or
take
time
off
of
work
to
go
back
and
forth
or
try
to
find
a
ride
.

great
service
,
great
pricing
and
super
convenient
!

i
also
did
not
feel
like
they
tried
to
sell
me
a
bunch
of
services
that
i
did
not
need
.

love
my
home
at
creekside

i
moved
to
creekside
apartments
in
august
2008
with
a
6
-
month
lease
and
have
just
extended
it
for
another
13
months
!

the
management
from
julie
and
janice
to
the
work
staff
,
esp.
edwin
,
are
just
wonderful
.

they
have
been
extremely
helpful
whenever
i
have
asked
for
help
.

although
the
apartments
are
facing
stokes
street
and
close
to
the
bascom
light
rail
,
the
location
is
surprisingly
quiet
.

i
have
never
had
any
problems
with
loud
neighbors
or
concerns
about
safety
.

the
apartments
are
within
walking
distance
to
trader
joe
's
,
whole
foods
,
and
other
stores
.

the
well
-
equipped
,
clean
gym
is
a
plus
!

great
place
to
live
if
you
work
in
and
around
downtown
san
jose
!

i
interviewed
several
contractors
for
a
kitchen
remodel
.

liberty
construction
shows
up
and
it
's
two
guys
...
all
i
get
is
100
%
sales
pitch
"
we
're
the
best
...
we
're
number
50
so
we
must
be
doing
something
right
...
look
at
all
these
certificates
that
say
we
're
great
"
.

not
once
did
i
feel
listened
to
like
they
actually
cared
about
what
i
wanted
,
all
they
were
interested
in
was
me
signing
a
contract
right
then
and
there
.

very
high
pressured
sales
and
with
the
reviews
of
many
others
bad
service
.

i
'm
glad
i
trusted
my
gut
and
did
n't
get
sucked
into
doing
business
with
them
.

find
someone
you
trust
that
actually
hears
you
and
wants
to
do
the
job
right
.

do
n't
waste
your
time
or
money
!

i
took
my
3
year
old
son
here
at
the
weekend
and
to
be
honest
,
apart
from
the
shark
walkway
,
i
thought
it
was
rubbish
and
overpriced
.

even
taking
into
account
the
fact
that
my
3
year
old
wanted
to
run
most
of
the
way
round
,
it
took
us
just
over
one
hour
start
to
finish
.

if
you
have
been
to
the
london
aquarium
i
would
not
even
bother
with
this
.

if
you
are
really
desperate
for
something
to
pass
the
time
and
are
willing
to
shell
out
the
best
part
of
l
30
for
2
two
people
then
go
for
it
.

(
for
some
reason
it
will
not
let
me
rate
it
one
star
-
it
is
not
rated
5
by
me
!
)

cranmore
dental
and
implant
clinic
:
i
could
not
recommend
dr
david
nelson
enough
.

i
had
a
severe
phobia
of
attending
the
dentist
until
i
met
and
was
treated
by
dr
nelson
.

he
instantaneously
put
me
at
ease
and
his
ongoing
treatments
have
been
absolutely
pain
free
.

my
previous
apprehension
has
been
dismissed
and
i
no
longer
have
a
sinking
feeling
when
my
next
appointment
is
due
!

in
addition
to
the
core
treatment
,
dr
nelson
has
impressed
me
further
with
his
concern
and
interest
in
the
well
-
being
of
his
patients
-
his
dental
work
underpinned
by
a
strong
duty
of
care
to
every
patient
.

he
is
always
prepared
to
go
the
extra
mile
to
ensure
that
any
patient
discomfort
is
dealt
with
immediately

pam
gillies

best
salsa
(
hehehe
)

after
my
trees
were
cleaned
up
,
they
gave
me
a
jar
of
salsa
.

the
owner
warned
me
that
it
was
the
best
salsa
i
would
ever
had
,
and
he
was
right
.

no
joke
!

i
hate
to
say
check
them
out
just
for
the
salsa
,
but
james
,
i
need
another
jar
badly
:)
all
kidding
aside
,
they
are
a
very
good
company
,
i
have
a
hard
time
giving
any
service
biz
a
5
star
review
but
they
came
close
.

very
affordable
(
do
n't
call
it
cheap
)
and
their
trimmers
were
quick
and
courteous
when
i
got
home
from
work
.

and
the
salsa
,
be
sure
to
ask
for
a
jar
and
have
plenty
of
chips
around
,
you
will
need
them
.....

dr.
mann
killed
our
pet

yea
,
dr.
mann
ai
n't
so
great
.

we
took
our
beloved
kitty
to
him
and
it
came
back
dead
.

we
live
in
the
sub-division
around
the
corner
and
after
it
happened
and
we
brought
it
up
at
some
neighborhood
gatherings
we
discovered
that
several
people
from
this
neighborhood
alone
had
pets
go
to
dr.
mann
for
surgical
procedures
and
came
back
dead
.

if
you
take
him
here
for
shots
,
no
big
deal
but
i
would
never
let
this
man
apply
anesthetic
to
my
pet
ever
again
.

oh
,
they
also
charged
me
for
the
procedure
(
$
250
)
and
had
the
audacity
to
charge
me
a
$
25
'
disposal
'
fee
.

they
actually
itemized
it
as
a
disposal
fee
.

avoid
at
all
costs
.

one
of
the
worst
places

this
place
and
its
sister
store
peking
garden
are
the
worst
places
to
order
from
.

the
food
was
horrible
not
cooked
like
it
should
be
,
they
got
the
order
wrong
on
a
number
of
occasions
,
and
once
forgot
about
my
order
.

i
had
to
call
back
up
there
two
hours
later
and
the
lady
(
who
claimed
to
be
a
manager
)
said
my
food
was
on
the
way
,
and
she
did
nt
offer
to
compensate
me
in
any
kind
of
way
.

i
waited
another
30
mins
before
receiving
my
food
and
it
was
cold
.

in
my
opinon
this
place
should
be
shut
down
by
the
health
inspector
,
and
anyone
who
is
satisfied
with
there
service
and
food
has
never
eaten
at
a
real
asian
restaurant
.

gone
downhill
since
change
in
ownership

sigh
.

i
used
to
love
this
place
.

but
now
that
they
are
part
of
a
chain
,
service
has
slipped
.

i
am
waiting
longer
at
bna
for
my
pickups
and
last
time
i
parked
with
them
,
they
lost
my
car
key
.

lucky
i
had
a
spare
with
me
!

to
date
they
have
not
made
good
by
either
finding
the
key
or
paying
for
a
new
one
.

(
these
new
car
keys
are
expensive
to
copy
,
you
ca
n't
just
go
to
walmart
.
)

go
to
the
website
for
coupons
and
join
the
club
-
you
can
get
free
parking
.

however
,
with
bna
offering
one
day
of
free
parking
due
to
construction
of
the
new
rental
car
facility
,
it
may
be
cheaper
to
park
at
bna
.

wife
and
i
attempted
to
adopt
a
dog
and
was
nothing
but
frustrating
.

we
arrived
sunday
at
about
230
and
found
a
do
we
really
liked
.

we
were
told
that
we
could
n't
today
because
they
were
closing
soon
.

i
called
the
next
morning
to
let
then
know
my
wife
would
be
driving
in
.

they
gave
me
the
run
around
and
missing
paperwork
only
to
call
back
to
tell
me
someone
else
wanted
her
and
i
would
need
to
come
in
and
put
down
a
deposit
.

i
work
2
hours
away
but
offered
my
card
over
the
phone
.

they
refused
.

terrible
communication
as
well
.

at
one
point
they
told
me
the
dog
had
been
fixed
,
the
next
day
it
had
n't
.

huge
ammount
of
time
wasted
time
and
elevated
blood
pressure
.

college
is
a
joke
and
the
salon
is
a
joke
!

went
to
the
school
here
over
priced
!!!!!!

you
do
not
learn
the
things
you
were
promised
.

you
have
to
bring
in
your
own
models
and
they
have
to
pay
for
you
to
use
them
if
you
do
nt
then
you
can
graduate
!

going
back
after
graduating
you
r
told
you
get
a
discount
on
services
nope
you
do
nt
.

staff
is
under
educated
.

going
there
you
learn
the
school
does
not
care
about
the
services
given
just
about
the
money
.

over
priced
for
students
to
learn
!

beware
of
the
nail
program
you
are
not
taught
to
use
a
nail
drill
at
all
you
learn
the
old
fashioned
way
of
doing
nails
you
will
not
be
able
to
do
well
in
a
salon
!!!

beware
!

you
can
fool
people

this
store
is
proof
that
you
can
fool
people
with
good
advertising
.

they
convince
lots
of
people
that
they
are
a
great
store
,
when
in
fact
they
are
a
very
average
place
at
best
,
they
are
just
another
big
box
store
like
the
others
.

they
offer
sales
that
are
n't
really
sales
,
mislabeled
items
that
make
the
item
sound
like
a
good
deal
when
it
is
n't
,
a
bad
attitude
about
return
items
,
and
on
and
on
.

with
higher
than
average
prices
to
boot
!

so
do
n't
get
taken
in
,
keep
your
eyes
open
if
you
choose
to
shop
here
.

on
the
other
hand
,
the
richmond
ukrops
chain
is
known
for
its
charity
work
,
its
community
action
,
and
its
interest
in
the
public
welfare
.

never
again

do
n't
go
here
unless
you
want
to
sit
,
order
,
eat
and
be
asked
to
leave
all
in
a
matter
of
20
minutes
.

you
wo
n't
even
have
time
to
read
the
entire
menu
before
being
asked
to
order
and
if
you
ask
for
more
time
your
server
will
wait
at
the
table
.

this
is
the
only
place
i
have
ever
eaten
and
been
told
to
leave
because
other
people
were
waiting
.

i
was
told
to
take
my
coffee
to
go
if
i
wanted
to
finish
it
.

oh
,
and
their
liquor
license
was
expired
so
no
bloody
mary
or
mimosas
.

plus
the
drinks
are
self
service
,
have
fun
trying
to
negotiate
the
small
cafeteria
space
to
get
your
coffee
,
juice
or
water
.

go
next
door
to
the
ball
square
cafe
instead
.

i
guess
you
get
what
you
pay
for
.

i
tried
to
stay
here
for
a
few
nights
with
my
girlfriend
,
so
we
asked
for
a
single
queen
bed
.

we
got
there
,
and
we
were
treated
to
the
free
"
upgrade
"
of
a
room
with
two
double
beds
.

since
they
consider
this
an
upgrade
,
they
let
their
other
rooms
fill
up
and
would
not
change
our
room
.

then
we
got
put
in
a
room
with
a
huge
gap
under
the
door
....
right
next
to
the
ice
machine
.

we
could
hear
every
single
thing
that
happened
outside
like
it
was
inside
our
room
.

when
i
finally
found
someone
at
the
desk
who
could
speak
english
,
they
moved
our
room
,
but
we
still
did
not
receive
the
single
queen
we
had
"
reserved
"

i
was
thoroughly
impressed
!

i
had
a
problem
with
the
tile
in
my
bathroom
coming
apart
.

i
called
a
few
different
businesses
in
the
area
to
get
estimates
,
they
were
n't
the
cheapest
i
found
but
very
reasonable
.

the
best
part
is
i
got
my
whole
bathroom
remodeled
for
about
the
same
price
the
other
compan's
were
quoting
just
to
fix
the
shower
tile
and
fixtures
.

they
had
the
work
done
in
about
half
the
time
quoted
which
made
me
and
my
wife
extremely
happy
.

we
have
had
nothing
but
compliments
on
our
bathroom
when
guest
come
over
-
who
would
have
guessed
that
one
?

very
nice
work
and
friendly
guys
too
.

best
money
i
've
spent
on
remodeling
ever
.

i
highly
recommend
any
one
considering
home
repair
to
give
these
guys
a
call
.

new
training
centre
is
excellent

the
award
dance
centre
has
moved
from
its
holderness
road
site
to
a
new
complex
on
chamberlain
road
hull
.

the
new
centre
has
4
studios
planned
and
now
boasts
the
largest
single
dance
floor
area
in
kingston
upon
hull
.

the
classes
cover
all
age
and
skill
ranges
,
with
ballroom
,
latin
,
sequence
,
street
,
disco
,
line
dancing
,
ballet
,
tap
&
jazz
.

we
have
attended
a
ward
dance
centre
for
over
a
year
and
really
enjoy
the
friendly
and
welcoming
way
we
are
taught
ballroom
and
latin
as
well
as
the
fun
filled
social
dance
evening
held
every
saturday
evening
....

it
is
not
really
possible
to
score
this
school
too
highly
,
we
would
give
it
12
out
of
10
and
5
stars
across
the
board
steve
&
anne

i
purchased
a
2
-
year
old
certified
pre-owned
bmw
from
this
dealership
.

the
night
i
drove
back
home
,
i
found
that
the
rear
window
has
some
leakage
.

(
you
can
hear
the
wind
while
driving
on
highway
.

very
likely
it
needs
a
new
window
seal
)
.

i
admit
that
i
should
have
paid
attention
to
this
kind
of
little
things
while
test
drive
.

(
but
this
is
a
certified
car
from
a
dealer
.
)

so
i
brought
the
car
back
the
second
day
.

they
told
me
that
this
is
not
under
warranty
and
want
to
charge
me
$
175
just
to
diagnose
the
problem
!

who
knows
how
much
they
want
me
to
pay
to
fix
this
thing
.

i
walked
away
.

so
my
advice
is
that
never
trust
this
dealer
.

stay
away
as
far
as
possible
.

perfect
practice

after
i
had
chosen
the
fountain
dental
practice
they
provided
a
slick
and
professional
service
from
start
to
finish
.

everyone
was
friendly
from
the
receptionist
to
the
surgeon
herself
,
putting
me
at
my
ease
and
explaining
the
whole
process
,
both
initially
and
then
as
we
went
along
.

surgery
visit
timings
were
always
made
to
suit
me
and
not
them
and
they
gave
me
the
feeling
that
i
mattered
and
was
important
to
them
.

the
surgery
itself
is
slick
,
modern
and
very
relaxed
and
i
always
felt
that
i
was
in
capable
hands
.

my
dental
surgeon
,
dr.
lucy
nichols
is
clearly
a
dental
perfectionist
and
clearly
proud
both
of
the
work
she
does
and
the
reputation
she
has
established
.

everyone
was
so
helpful
that
i
can
not
wait
to
go
back
.....

wonderful
service
for
large
group

i
had
my
wedding
luncheon
at
this
bj
s
restaurant
,
and
it
was
one
of
the
best
choices
that
i
made
.

it
was
a
great
deal
--
we
paid
a
certain
amount
per
person
,
and
my
husband
and
i
chose
4
types
of
pizza
and
the
servers
brought
out
as
much
as
we
wanted
.

we
were
also
served
salad
and
soda
.

we
had
a
large
party
,
about
fifty
people
or
so
,
and
yet
everything
was
served
quickly
and
we
all
had
a
wonderful
time
.

even
though
we
were
only
supposed
to
have
those
specific
types
of
pizza
,
when
guests
asked
for
a
different
type
,
it
was
brought
out
with
no
charge
to
us
!

i
really
appreciate
bj
s
for
making
that
special
day
even
better
with
their
wonderful
food
and
service
.

wonderful

i
went
to
ohm
after
reading
some
of
the
reviews
.

i
go
to
school
in
the
area
and
usually
wait
until
i
go
home
to
get
my
hair
cut
.

i
decided
it
was
time
to
grow
up
and
made
an
appointment
.

sierra
was
my
stylist
and
i
love
what
she
did
.

i
have
wavy
hair
and
she
cut
to
my
hair
style
.

it
was
the
first
time
i
had
left
a
salon
with
my
hair
curly
.

usually
they
blow
dry
it
out
and
i
have
to
wait
until
i
wash
it
to
see
what
it
will
look
like
in
its
natural
state
.

but
she
did
a
fabulous
job
letting
me
know
what
she
was
doing
at
all
times
and
styled
my
hair
in
a
way
i
could
do
it
at
home
.

it
was
n't
completly
impossible
!!!!

i
am
definitely
going
back

after
recently
relocating
to
south
bend
,
we
were
looking
for
a
delicious
,
fun
,
yet
elegant
establishment
for
new
year
s
eve
dinner
.

we
were
disappointed
with
this
holiday
dinner
due
to
the
overall
flavor
and
price
of
the
meal
,
and
accessibility
to
the
jazz
club
.

the
meal
was
extremely
overpriced
and
lacked
flavor
,
especially
for
being
a
special
nye
menu
.

the
limited
menu
had
few
appetizing
options
and
the
nye
special
packages
were
way
overpriced
.

after
our
meal
,
our
server
found
us
a
table
in
the
jazz
club
where
we
were
informed
it
would
be
another
$
10
/
person
to
stay
and
listen
to
the
band
,
despite
the
fact
we
had
just
finished
a
dinner
there
and
were
intending
to
enjoy
their
drink
list
.

this
was
a
less
than
impressive
experience
at
trio
's
.

run
for
the
hills
...
you
'll
be
much
better
off
!

one
night
was
too
much
.

first
room
had
used
tissues
next
to
the
bed
and
i
requested
it
be
rectified
.

i
was
then
moved
to
another
room
around
the
back
where
the
room
was
dirty
,
the
shower
was
dirty
with
other
people
s
hair
in
it
,
the
toilet
seat
was
peeling
and
rough
and
the
bathroom
was
full
of
mould
.

i
called
reception
to
ask
if
they
knew
the
state
the
room
was
in
and
was
told
"
this
is
a
days
inn
,
not
the
hilton
"
and
the
receptionist
then
hung
up
on
me
.

to
warn
you
to
stay
away
from
this
place
just
is
n't
enough
.

there
was
not
one
ounce
of
caring
involved
and
anyone
i
can
warn
about
the
complete
lack
of
service
will
be
warned
.

grocery
and
daily
needs
store

before
using
fusionretail
before
installing
fusionretail
store
was
running
on
a
dos
based
software
.

we
were
having
a
major
problem
in
maintaining
cash
.

being
a
grocery
shop
,
maintaining
5000
different
products
was
a
challenging
job
.

managing
pos
counter
without
barcoding
was
really
a
tough
time
.

how
fusionretail
has
overcome
these
issues
?

fusionretail
helps
us
to
maintain
the
store
in
an
organised
way
.

usage
of
product
barcodes
and
smooth
maintenance
of
inventory
with
proper
recording
of
transactions
like
sale
,
purchase
and
returns
was
never
easy
before
.

how
long
does
it
take
to
train
new
people
at
work
?

billing
takes
15
minutes
and
back
office
jobs
takes
1
day
's

how
fast
your
support
queries
get

over

,
immediate
.

on

,
it
takes
a
day
to
get
our
issues
resolved
.

ca
n't
wait
to
go
back
!!!

this
is
by
far
the
best
b&b
that
we
have
ever
stayed
at
!

we
were
in
santa
fe
for
a
special
event
and
our
hosts
rented
out
the
el
paradero
for
all
their
guests
to
stay
at
.

we
could
not
have
been
more
welcomed
,
more
comfortable
or
more
well
fed
.

the
weekend
was
perfect
in
every
way
,
in
large
part
to
sue
and
her
great
staff
.

everyone
was
so
friendly
and
really
went
out
of
their
way
to
make
sure
everything
went
well
.

we
can
not
wait
to
go
back
to
santa
fe
and
to
this
great
b&b
...
especially
my
4
year
old
,
who
made
friends
with
ms.
sue
and
all
the
ladies
,
and
has
talked
about
them
since
we
left
!

we
would
highly
recommend
the
el
paradero
on
your
next
trip
to
santa
fe
!

disatisfied
customer
,
i
went
through
kitchen
aid
and
used
one
of
their
recommended
vendors
.

a&e
came
out
,
charged
$
129
fee
just
to
walk
in
the
door
.

i
needed
a
part
for
my
appliance
,
the
cost
was
very
high
so
i
said
never
mind
,
paid
the
fee
and
called
a
local
business
for
a
second
quote
.

the
second
vendor
charged
$
55
(
less
than
half
of
what
a&e
charges
)
to
come
and
applied
that
to
the
price
of
the
repair
service
(
which
a&e
does
not
)
.

their
quote
came
in
at
half
the
price
of
a&e
for
the
same
work
and
same
part
.

seems
to
me
like
a&e
charges
way
more
than
necessary
!

very
disappointed
in
kitchen
aid
as
well
,
i
thought
that
they
pre-screened
their
vendors
for
price
and
quality
of
work
,
obviously
they
do
not
!

lovely
nails
on
cayuga
st.
in
lewiston
,
ny

first
let
me
start
out
by
saying
,
that
i
have
had
very
nice
pedicures
at
lovely
nails
on
military
road
.

i
was
very
excited
that
a
salon
was
opening
in
lewiston
,
as
i
live
in
youngstown
.

i
was
in
two
weeks
ago
and
had
the
worst
pedicure
that
i
have
had
in
my
life
.

there
were
four
of
us
and
i
was
taken
first
by
a
gentleman
.

i
put
my
foot
in
the
water
and
it
was
cool
.

he
did
warm
it
up
.

he
also
hurt
my
toes
will
pushing
my
cuticles
back
.

if
the
pedicure
lasted
20
mins.
,
that
was
a
stretch
.

the
other
ladies
had
a
similar
experience
,
both
had
nail
polish
on
a
couple
of
toes
.

none
of
us
will
be
using
their
services
again
,
which
is
a
shame
.

good
service
-
limited
results

andrew
was
helpful
and
knowledgeable
about
acupuncture
re
:
infertility
.

he
was
willing
to
talk
to
me
about
my
specific
issues
and
develop
a
plan
of
action
.

the
office
is
shared
with
a
foot
doctor
and
it
's
very
sterile
and
medical
feeling
,
which
i
liked
.

the
down
side
was
that
sometimes
there
was
a
lot
of
noise
in
the
hallway
from
other
patients
/
doctors
.

i
worked
with
andrew
for
2
months
and
did
acupuncture
and
herbs
.

the
sessions
were
nice
and
i
felt
relaxed
after
them
but
did
not
notice
any
changes
with
my
cycles
.

i
know
it
can
take
a
while
for
results
and
did
n't
expect
a
miracle
,
but
after
2
months
i
felt
like
it
was
not
entirely
worth
the
cost
/
time
.

(
i
am
also
a
little
suspicious
of
all
these
glowing
reviews
...
)

friendly
,
clean
and
excellent
location

the
staff
was
very
helpful
,
and
gave
us
good
advice
on
day
and
night
time
activities
.

common
room
was
comfortable
and
clean
,
very
good
room
to
read
or
relax
.
-

a
great
breakfast
which
was
included
every
morning
until
9:30
am
;
yummy
fresh
parisian
croissants
.

comfortable
and
clean
beds
,
a
bit
noisy
when
people
were
coming
in
late
from
a
night
out
,
but
we
did
n't
mind
too
much
as
we
were
also
just
coming
in
from
a
night
out
!

the
location
is
really
stellar
!

it
is
next
to
gare
du
nord
and
a
five
minute
walk
to
sacre
coeur
which
is
excellent
for
shopping
.

it
is
close
to
bus
lines
for
opera
plaza
,
galleries
lafayette
,
and
the
famous
flea
market
.

we
really
enjoyed
our
stay
and
would
definitely
stay
at
the
vintage
hostel
again
.

just
autos
thank
you
!

was
fast
and
easy
,
just
had
our
car
returned
this
morning
,
i
would
recommend
these
mobile
mechanics
for
sure
.

they
certainly
know
what
they
are
doing
.

the
mechanic
came
to
our
place
and
sorted
out
our
car
s
problems
,
he
explained
the
problem
and
was
very
up
front
and
honest
,
it
was
towed
to
the
workshop
as
the
gearbox
was
not
working
(
he
explained
it
better
)
.

they
phoned
the
same
day
,
confirmed
it
was
the
gearbox
quoted
me
the
job
,
i
gave
the
go
ahead
.

now
my
car
s
gears
and
brakes
have
never
run
so
well
...
ever
it
s
like
driving
a
new
car
.

so
yes
,
i
would
n't
hesitate
in
recommending
the
team
at
just
autos
for
easy
professional
car
repairs
,
thank
you
just
autos
for
your
help
.

i
stopped
in
today
@
yards
brewery
.

i
must
say
,
i
was
impressed
with
the
size
of
the
bar
area
and
lounge
,
&
i
liked
that
you
could
see
the
brewery
right
thru
the
glass
!

i
had
a
sampler
of
ipa
,
brawler
,
love
stout
&
esa
.

all
were
awesome
,
&
i
had
a
dogwood
grilled
cheese
which
was
enjoyable
with
the
fine
beers
.

after
my
sampler
&
sandwich
,
i
asked
for
a
pint
of
there
nitrogen
love
stout
,
i
must
say
i
was
impressed
,
with
the
great
taste
&
i
am
a
guiness
lover
so
coming
from
me
,
i
think
this
is
better
,
it
s
less
dry
&
smoother
!

if
you
are
in
philly
you
have
to
come
check
this
place
out
!

the
only
negative
i
have
abou
this
place
is
the
parking
!

i
left
with
a
case
of
brawler
!!!!

oil
change
disaster

my
wife
had
taken
her
'07
ford
fusion
in
for
a
routine
oil
change
.

a
couple
days
after
the
oil
change
,
the
engine
ran
rough
,
the
low
oil
pressure
light
would
come
on
sporadically
,
and
the
engine
would
whir
loudly
.

turns
out
the
engine
had
no
oil
,
and
when
oil
was
put
it
,
it
would
just
run
out
of
the
filter
.

there
could
have
(
hopefully
does
n't
have
)
major
damage
to
the
engine
.

all
of
this
started
after
their
oil
change
.

once
they
realized
their
mistake
they
sent
a
mechanic
and
tow
truck
to
my
wife
's
work
and
towed
it
back
to
fix
it
.

i
would
not
recommend
this
shop
for
anything
,
not
even
something
as
simple
as
an
oil
change
.

plus
they
will
overcharge
you
for
just
about
everything
,
and
smile
while
doing
it
.

liars
,
negative
stars
!

took
my
cruze
in
twice
for
poor
fuel
economy
.

the
first
time
they
claimed
to
get
reasonable
mpg
.

however
,
they
would
never
drive
the
car
with
me
in
it
to
prove
their
findings
.

i
wonder
if
they
were
going
down
a
hill
!

they
told
me
to
bring
it
back
after
5000
miles
.

i
brought
it
back
with
9000
miles
.

they
"
finished
"
the
work
and
told
me
the
car
was
ready
.

i
found
out
they
did
not
even
drive
the
car
,
stated
they
looked
at
it
before
.

they
still
would
not
drive
the
car
with
me
to
show
their
mpg
number
.

they
also
claimed
not
to
see
anything
wrong
with
the
blower
fan
(
a
seperate
issue
)
,
but
when
i
drove
the
car
home
i
had
the
same
symptoms
.

i
will
never
purchace
another
vehicle
from
vic
canever
.

great
job

i
want
to
say
that
mike
did
a
great
job
for
our
family
in
our
time
of
need
.

both
my
grandparents
passed
away
4
months
apart
and
mike
was
very
understanding
.

it
was
a
very
trying
time
for
my
family
and
myself
yet
mike
took
the
time
to
greet
each
and
every
one
one
of
us
.

he
is
very
professional
in
his
position
as
a
director
and
yet
he
still
made
time
to
be
compassionate
for
what
we
were
all
going
through
.

i
'm
sure
it
s
not
every
day
that
a
funeral
director
sees
the
same
family
in
such
a
short
time
.

my
grandfather
passed
away
silently
in
his
sleep
,
and
my
grandmother
passed
away
after
a
short
struggle
with
cancer
.

both
my
grandparents
looked
as
natural
as
could
be
expected
.

thank
you
mike
for
all
your
help
professionally
and
personally
.

poor
service

if
you
like
the
drama
described
in
popular
sitcom
'
seinfeld
'
,
you
will
see
it
here
.

we
signed
our
name
in
about
6:00
pm
.

there
were
3
names
before
us
.

the
greeter
said
there
was
about
15
minutes
waiting
.

however
,
we
waited
and
waited
and
in
the
mean
time
,
saw
4
groups
of
people
simply
just
paraded
in
without
signing
there
names
.

this
sign
in
policy
is
posted
by
the
restaurant
"
no
reservation
,
sign
your
name
here
"
.

i
had
to
ask
the
greeter
,
he
explained
his
reasons
with
broken
english
.

i
could
not
understand
any
his
reasons
.

i
could
only
take
it
as
they
would
seat
the
people
they
know
first
.

my
conclusion
is
that
you
should
only
go
there
if
you
want
to
wait
a
least
an
hour
and
see
all
kinds
other
people
being
seated
before
you
.

instructor
never
showed
up
!

january
15th
--
we
were
signed
up
for
saturday
's
2
pm
class
"
beginning
yoga
with
brittany
.
"

we
even
arrived
10
minutes
early
as
the
website
suggests
.

the
instructor
did
not
show
up
!

we
waited
until
2:25
pm
and
then
left
.

there
were
2
in
our
group
,
and
a
3rd
person
was
also
in
the
parking
lot
waiting
for
this
class
.

well
,
not
much
i
can
say
except
i
'm
very
disappointed
with
this
experience
.

this
was
our
first
visit
to
your
studio
.

in
today
's
instant
world
,
there
's
no
reason
for
the
instructor
not
to
even
have
given
us
a
phone
call
or
e-mail
if
she
was
going
to
be
late
.

as
a
yoga
studio
,
i
'm
sure
you
're
all
aware
that
all
actions
generate
karma
.

and
sometimes
karma
can
manifest
itself
on
a
bad
review
on
google
.

finest
??

really
??

i
beg
to
differ
.

this
place
is
marginal
at
best
.

not
very
welcoming
and
focused
mostly
on
keeping
little
kids
entertained
.

i
was
not
impressed
,
and
quite
frustrated
at
their
lack
of
rating
for
their
courses
.

i
understand
not
wanting
to
put
labels
like
5.10
on
an
indoor
course
,
because
yes
,
it
is
not
the
same
,
but
some
clear
understanding
of
the
difficulty
of
one
course
to
another
is
nice
when
you
are
an
intermediate
climber
looking
to
improve
.

i
do
n't
want
to
waste
my
time
on
routes
set
for
children
,
but
i
do
n't
want
to
take
on
something
i
ca
n't
handle
just
to
strain
myself
to
exhaustion
.

rate
the
routes
,
with
understandable
markings
and
a
more
detailed
system
than
easy
,
moderate
,
and
hard
.

again
,
a
great
outing
for
the
kids
,
a
frustration
for
an
out
of
town
climber
.

best
dj's
in
town
!

wow
!

these
guys
were
the
best
.

they
were
thorough
,
high
class
,
and
went
above
and
beyond
.

we
never
had
to
worry
about
a
thing
,
and
they
led
the
way
the
whole
time
.

they
asked
us
things
that
we
would
have
never
have
thought
of
,
and
took
extra
time
to
meet
with
us
when
we
needed
it
before
the
wedding
.

having
a
team
was
the
best
because
they
kept
the
flow
of
the
wedding
going
the
whole
time
!

they
may
look
young
but
do
n't
let
that
fool
you
,
as
their
knowledge
of
music
far
surpassed
what
we
expected
.

i
am
a
music
junkie
that
grew
up
in
the
80's
,
and
my
dad
worked
for
a
record
label
in
the
1960's
.

so
we
did
n't
expect
them
to
even
know
some
of
the
requests
that
we
asked
that
night
.

they
just
really
know
their
stuff
!

never
fear
going
to
the
dentist
again
!

i
'm
61
years
old
and
have
dental
problems
my
entire
life
.

by
the
age
of
24
i
stopped
going
to
the
dentist
.

my
fear
and
discomfort
from
dental
work
scared
me
!

it
took
all
the
courage
i
could
muster
to
make
an
appointment
.

at
the
front
door
of
his
office
,
i
nearly
turned
around
.

i
considered
just
leaving
after
going
inside
and
nearly
did
.

doctor
gonzales
and
his
entire
staff
are
the
most
professional
people
i
have
ever
dealt
with
.

they
made
me
feel
confident
in
what
they
would
do
,
and
treated
me
like
a
member
of
their
own
family
.

i
never
felt
pain
or
discomfort
.

the
ability
to
smile
and
eat
again
can
only
be
described
as
a
whole
new
lease
on
life
.

thank
you
doctor
gonzales
,
doctor
stout
,
eva
marie
and
the
entire
staff

horrible
service
and
food

not
only
is
this
place
too
expensive
for
what
it
is
,
it
s
horrible
!

in
the
past
,
i
got
a
steak
and
there
was
more
fat
and
rough
pieces
than
there
was
good
steak
(
and
this
was
the
sirloin
!
)
,
the
sides
were
drenched
with
butter
and
the
salad
was
a
little
on
the
brown
side
.

today
we
went
for
a
party
(
during
lunch
,
so
the
place
was
empty
)
with
about
25
other
people
.

it
took
over
1.5
hours
for
our
food
to
come
out
and
by
that
time
my
8
month
old
had
it
!

does
it
seriously
take
that
long
for
a
soup
and
salad
?

i
was
a
waitress
for
years
and
a
key
rule
is
to
serve
customers
with
small
children
before
others
,
as
i
was
the
last
to
get
my
food
.

i
would
not
recommend
having
a
party
here
or
even
going
here
.

texas
roadhouse
is
way
better

spay
and
neuter
service
.

i
have
no
doubt
that
the
rescue
is
wonderful
.

but
i
had
my
cat
spayed
through
their
reduced
/
free
spay
and
neuter
program
and
the
vet
they
sent
us
to
was
first
of
all
a
hour
and
a
half
away
,
and
4
days
later
we
had
to
bring
them
to
our
normal
vet
because
the
vets
at
the
place
in
wisconsin
did
a
crappy
job
and
they
got
infections
.

my
vet
even
said
it
was
not
my
fault
it
was
the
vet
that
did
the
surgery
,
so
i
would
not
recommend
getting
that
program
unless
you
have
an
extra
hundred
dollars
or
so
for
antibiotics
and
a
vet
visit
.

you
'd
think
they
would
do
a
good
job
but
they
do
n't
care
unless
they
are
getting
paid
full
price
.

which
is
so
dumb
.

not
to
mention
the
fact
that
they
gave
us
our
cats
back
not
even
30
minutes
after
they
were
out
from
surgery
.

billing
issues
...

i
had
a
routine
surgery
for
an
ingrown
toenail
.

my
insurance
company
,
blue
cross
/
blue
shield
paid
the
fees
and
everything
was
fine
.

then
i
got
a
bill
for
$
483.00
.

the
doctor
's
office
said
that
payments
had
been
"
reversed
"
.

blue
cross
has
no
record
of
aa
reversal
.

the
office
refused
my
requests
to
see
what
they
got
from
bc
/
bs
.

they
eventually
turned
it
over
to
a
collection
agency
and
now
will
not
even
discuss
the
matter
.

i
eventually
decided
to
just
pay
the
balance
even
though
the
doctor
has
already
been
paid
,
but
now
the
collection
agency
is
trying
to
say
another
reversal
of
$
160.00
has
come
through
.

it
was
an
ingrown
toenail
.

how
much
could
it
possibly
cost
?

not
only
am
i
being
bilked
for
money
i
do
not
owe
,
the
office
staff
is
rude
to
boot
.

i
think
this
office
has
some
serious
billing
practice
issues
!

we
have
been
blessed
to
find
elite
flyers
online
and
would
not
use
anyone
else
to
handle
our
postcards
,
posters
,
etc
.

we
were
looking
for
a
company
with
decent
rates
as
our
company
was
just
getting
started
.

they
have
the
best
rates
and
great
customer
service
.

on
one
order
,
we
needed
it
rushed
and
shipped
to
a
different
state
.

they
did
that
with
no
problem
.

i
also
appreciate
their
honesty
.

i
sent
a
graphic
that
would
have
been
distorted
if
printed
as
it
was
.

they
called
and
worked
with
me
to
fix
it
so
that
it
would
look
perfect
.

they
recently
surprised
me
a
larger
order
.

i
ordered
1000
postcards
,
we
normally
order
5000
or
more
.

because
they
had
room
to
do
5000
,
they
created
the
larger
amount
,
and
shipped
them
early
.

i
recommend
this
company
to
anyone
and
everyone
that
needs
great
work
done
at
a
reasonable
rate
!

they
have
a
customer
for
life
in
us
!

sheisters

i
made
the
mistake
of
buying
from
these
thieves
.

i
paid
2
k
cash
for
a
truck
with
a
blown
motor
.

their
so
called
mechanic
said
the
engine
was
good
and
"
there
is
nothing
mechanicly
wrong
with
this
truck
"
.

well
i
think
a
blown
engine
falls
under
the
catagory
of
mechanics
right
?

anyway
they
jimmy
rigged
it
so
i
could
drive
it
home
.

the
next
day
i
took
it
to
2
auto
shops
and
they
both
told
me
the
same
thing
,
engine
is
junk
.

i
called
and
got
the
same
runaround
on
hold
and
noone
calls
you
back
.

from
a
moral
standpoint
,
you
guys
are
really
gon
na
take
2,000
bucks
from
someone
that
needs
that
truck
to
work
and
support
his
family
when
you
know
it
s
just
a
piece
of
scrap
metal
?

if
it
lasted
1

best
stationery
store
in
bethesda

papeluna
,
a
cute
mom
/
pop
custom
printing
and
paper
store
,
just
opened
a
few
days
ago
.

it
is
right
on
the
hustle
and
bustle
of
wisconsin
ave
but
some
might
miss
it
as
it
is
nestled
in
between
subway
sandwiches
and
modell
's
.

i
popped
in
after
my
afternoon
pumpkin
spice
latte
break
at
starbucks
.

it
's
an
adorable
little
store
filled
with
lots
of
stationery
goodness
.

cards
,
wrapping
paper
,
paper
,
and
an
area
to
sit
down
and
talk
with
someone
to
design
your
own
invitations
or
for
whatever
else
your
custom
printing
needs
may
be
.

i
gave
the
woman
i
spoke
with
today
a
"
you
've
been
yelped
!
"
card
to
let
her
know
that
yelp
may
be
a
good
tool
for
helping
spreading
the
word
about
papeluna
.

i
ended
up
buying
a
birthday
card
and
would
probably
come
back
for
more
.

watch
out
for
your
wallet

this
company
is
overpriced
for
their
services
.

they
pride
themselves
on
being
an
event
and
team
building
company
for
corporate
clients
but
you
better
believe
they
are
going
to
mark
you
up
on
that
feel
good
premise
.

on
a
recent
event
quote
that
i
had
done
,
they
came
in
thousands
of
dollars
over
their
local
competition
.

the
craziest
part
is
that
they
are
n't
even
based
locally
at
the
city
i
'm
in
-
they
just
have
'
teams
'
in
areas
through
the
country
.

i
've
spoken
to
vendors
who
are
used
by
them
who
had
nothing
good
to
say
about
the
company
as
well
and
in
fact
were
afraid
to
quote
events
against
them
even
though
they
openly
admitted
that
they
felt
canadian
outback
was
pricing
their
entertainment
out
of
the
market
and
doing
more
to
hurt
their
business
than
help
them
.

be
warned
-
they
'll
ltake
you
for
everything
they
can
.

believe
me
.

this
is
the
premier
university
in
virginia
.

it
is
also
the
largest
.

with
a
pizza
hut
,
ihop
,
3
starbucks
,
chili
s
,
panera
,
and
chipotle
on
campus
alone
,
vcu
has
some
of
the
best
eating
options
for
students
.

vcu
has
the
1
art
school
in
america
,
and
excels
in
healthcare
and
medical
schooling
.

the
rams
,
the
vcu
sports
team
,
also
made
the
ncaa
final
4
this
year
,
too
!

vcu
also
offers
high
-
rise
living
for
students
and
professors
,
and
the
historic
yet
fixed
-
up
houses
in
the
fan
are
also
available
to
students
,
professors
,
or
even
people
wanting
to
live
in
a
safe
,
viable
community
.

vcu
is
also
minutes
from
downtown
richmond
,
canal
walk
,
carytown
,
stony
point
,
short
pump
,
and
the
vcu
medical
center
.

it
is
the
best
university
in
virginia
and
continuously
receives
rave
reviews
every
year
.

the
u
of
r
is
also
recommended
,
too
!

orr
's
a
nightmare
!

do
n't
go
!

my
boyfriend
and
i
were
woken
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
at
our
campsite
by
drunken
kids
who
'd
arrived
around
1:00
am
and
were
drinking
at
the
springs
.

when
we
complained
to
the
management
(
as
we
were
instructed
to
do
if
there
were
any
problems
)
,
nothing
happened
!

then
,
the
next
morning
,
when
we
,
among
many
other
irate
guests
,
asked
to
speak
to
the
owner
,
he
refused
to
do
so
.

not
only
that
,
but
he
told
us
,
via
his
manager
,
that
it
was
our
responsibility
to
get
up
a
second
time
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
call
the
night
staff
if
the
problem
continued
,
even
though
his
manager
did
nothing
the
first
time
to
stop
the
kids
.

orr
is
not
relaxing
,
it
's
not
a
safe
space
,
and
the
owner
is
awful
.

to
add
insult
to
injury
,
he
refused
to
refund
our
money
.

do
n't
go
!

fhs
is
a
good
high
school
--
c
/
o
1998

i
enjoyed
my
time
at
franklin
high
school
.

we
had
relatively
good
facilities
at
the
time
--
decent
science
labs
,
with
multiple
hoods
and
access
to
good
equipment
;
nice
gymnasiums
,
and
a
well
-
funded
music
department
(
i
was
in
the
guitar
ensemble
)
.

now
,
of
course
,
there
's
a
new
building
,
with
presumably
better
facilities
.

all
to
the
good
.

for
those
who
care
,
a
good
proportion
of
the
my
class
went
on
to
4
-
year
colleges
,
many
of
them
ranked
in
the
top
50
of
us
news
.

if
i
remember
,
students
went
to
dartmouth
,
u.
penn
,
duke
,
bu
,
william
and
mary
,
vassar
,
howard
,
and
carnegie
mellon
,
among
others
.

many
students
went
to
rutgers
,
including
their
top
-
ranked
pharmacy
program
.

the
point
is
--
fhs
gives
you
the
opportunity
to
make
it
to
a
good
college
,
but
you
need
to
work
hard
.

absolutely
the
best
little
motel
on
the
coast
!

i
've
stayed
at
this
fabulous
little
motel
two
years
running
,
and
i
have
to
say
it
's
one
of
the
best
lodging
experiences
i
've
ever
had
on
the
coast
...
and
i
'm
even
comparing
it
to
the
big
resorts
i
've
stayed
at
!

a
large
group
of
my
friends
and
i
rent
almost
the
whole
motel
every
year
for
a
weekend
,
and
the
experience
and
stay
have
always
been
five
-
star
.

the
rooms
are
so
clean
,
the
managers
/
owners
are
the
nicest
people
,
the
place
feels
so
homey
,
and
the
location
and
grounds
are
beautiful
.

there
's
a
restaurant
nearby
(
walking
distance
)
with
a
great
breakfast
,
and
a
market
across
the
street
.

the
motel
is
very
well
maintained
,
and
the
managers
are
so
accomodating
,
it
's
kind
of
like
visiting
family
each
year
!
;-)

i
honestly
ca
n't
rave
enough
about
this
place
...
it
's
really
a
hidden
gem
worth
checking
out
!

my
favorite
cuban
cafe
in
orlando

i
have
been
eating
cuban
for
a
long
time
,
sandwiches
mainly
along
with
other
dishes
..

i
love
cuban
coffee
,
colada
...
mmmm
anyways
i
found
this
place
and
ca
n't
stop
going
there
,
i
stop
in
at
least
once
a
week
and
anytime
i
'm
in
the
area
for
a
cuban
coffee
or
snack
.

the
place
is
chill
and
comfortable
.

they
do
n't
speak
the
best
english
but
enough
to
get
by
.

they
bake
bread
fresh
daily
,
they
do
n't
press
their
sandwiches
which
is
the
way
i
like
it
,
and
the
meat
is
always
fresh
.

they
have
a
great
lunch
special
with
your
choice
of
meat
,
chicken
,
steak
,
or
pork
and
rice
and
black
beans
and
fried
plantains
.

and
their
breakfast
is
awesome
!!

i
can
not
describe
how
delicious
the
mango
and
cheese
pastries
and
the
omelets
are
to
die
for
.

stop
in
and
have
a
bite
you
wo
n't
regret
it
.

a
slice
of
heaven
in
winter
park
off
forsyth
!

highly
recommended
.

i
have
been
going
to
warner
family
for
a
number
of
years
and
would
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
.

i
've
read
some
of
the
reviews
below
and
would
like
to
state
that
yes
,
like
any
other
doctor
s
office
there
is
sometimes
a
wait
(
depending
on
what
other
patients
are
being
seen
for
)
and
some
of
the
tests
and
procedures
that
are
ran
can
be
costly
(
just
like
they
would
be
for
any
other
medical
tests
elsewhere
if
you
do
not
have
insurance
)
...

i
have
seen
several
of
the
providers
from
the
office
and
have
not
once
been
shown
anything
but
care
and
consideration
.

i
ca
nt
speak
for
them
but
any
tests
or
appointments
they
recommend
are
probably
in
the
best
interests
of
us
(
the
patient
)
and
you
have
the
ability
to
decline
anything
that
they
suggest
to
you
.

i
personally
have
had
wonderful
service
and
if
you
re
truely
looking
for
a
family
practice
...
warner
family
is
the
place
for
you
.

not
what
i
expected
!

we
read
the
good
reviews
before
going
and
had
high
hopes
..
but
to
our
dismay
it
did
nt
turn
out
that
way
!

~
it
took
over
40
mins
to
be
taken
to
our
table
,
once
there
it
took
another
20
mins
to
get
our
orders
and
a
further
45
mins
till
our
starters
landed
on
our
table
.

very
frustrating
for
a
restaurant
that
has
1
rosette
and
is
supposedly
renowned
for
the
service
...
hmm
there
was
no
canape's
or
amuse
to
keep
us
occupied
,
once
we
complained
about
the
wait
they
took
us
something
to
nibble
on
but
that
took
us
getting
out
our
chairs
and
wondering
round
to
do
that
and
it
was
impossible
to
get
anyone
s
attention
.

scallops
were
overcooked
and
the
foie
gras
was
cold
but
the
rest
of
the
food
was
lovely
.

on
top
of
that
though
they
tried
to
charge
us
service
charge
just
to
rub
it
it
....

would
n't
go
back
as
there
are
a
lot
of
places
a
lot
better
and
cheaper
.

nice
selection
,
very
clean
,
friendly
staff
!

hot
iron
has
become
a
favorite
of
our
family
.

everyone
can
get
the
signature
dish
with
ingredients
and
spices
that
they
want
and
have
the
fun
of
watching
it
cook
.

the
staff
are
very
friendly
and
conscientious
.

they
always
ask
if
you
have
meat
in
your
dish
,
(
for
vegetarians
like
me
)
,
they
scrub
an
area
of
the
grill
and
use
separate
utensils
to
cook
.

they
do
n't
just
dump
your
ingredients
on
and
cook
either
,
but
carefully
separate
meat
to
the
hotter
parts
of
the
grill
and
still
manage
to
keep
the
veggies
from
turning
to
mush
.

the
selection
of
meats
,
veggies
and
sauces
is
awesome
too
!

every
time
we
go
they
seem
to
have
a
different
ingredient
or
two
which
keeps
things
interesting
.

meats
are
kept
very
cold
,
seafood
smells
fresh
and
the
serving
bar
is
very
clean
.

prices
are
reasonable
,
(
kid
s
meals
are
around
4.99
)
and
wednesday's
they
have
discount
dinner
prices
,
i
believe
.

great
cookies
,
cakes
,
and
customer
service

it
was
my
birthday
and
i
had
a
last
minute
idea
to
have
a
bakery
cake
instead
of
one
pre-made
in
a
convenience
store
,
but
the
problem
was
it
was
the
day
before
valentine
s
and
when
many
bakeries
turned
me
down
for
a
plain
vanilla
rectangle
cake
,
fiona
stepped
up
to
the
plate
and
was
able
to
make
a
fantastic
beautiful
cake
.

not
only
did
it
taste
wonderful
,
but
the
texture
was
unbelievable
,
the
frosting
was
n't
overly
sweet
to
over
power
the
cake
,
and
the
cake
itself
was
just
amazingly
soft
,
and
fluffy
,
and
just
perfect
overall
.

although
i
'll
have
to
drive
a
little
out
of
my
way
to
go
there
,
i
'll
gladly
do
it
knowing
that
since
she
's
been
astounding
to
me
once
before
that
she
'll
always
be
that
way
!

(
also
she
has
a
really
great
website
!

and
we
bought
a
few
cookies
there
too
,
they
were
fantastic
as
well
!
)

she
deserves
many
5
star
reviews
!!

food
craving
gone
and
weight
loss
at
acupuncture
doctor

i
am
a
college
student
.

before
treatment
,
my
food
cravings
were
"
out
of
control
"
which
caused
me
to
be
stressed
out
.

i
experienced
a
definite
decrease
in
food
craving
(
about
50
%
)
and
decrease
in
stress
after
the
1st
treatment
.

i
actually
loss
4
pounds
after
my
1st
treatment
and
2
pounds
after
my
2nd
treatment
.

i
was
amazed
.

i
am
now
more
at
peace
and
my
food
craving
is
about
99
%
gone
after
only
3
treatments
.

before
coming
to
acupuncture
doctor
i
was
a
big
baby
about
needles
and
only
came
because
my
boyfriend
's
aunt
recommended
it
.

it
hurt
very
little
,
felt
more
like
pressure
than
pain
.

what
i
like
most
about
dr.
liau
is
that
she
is
very
caring
.

she
talks
to
you
at
each
appointment
.

i
can
tell
she
really
cares
and
wants
to
help
.

i
am
so
glad
to
have
found
dr.
liau
.

now
i
feel
more
confident
wearing
my
bathing
suit
in
the
summer
.

an
asset
to
richmond

for
a
long
time
,
one
big
source
of
entertainment
missing
from
the
richmond
city
limits
was
a
first
-
run
multiplex
.

bowtie
has
filled
that
role
nicely
.

the
theatre
is
in
an
old
brick
warehouse
,
which
is
a
block
away
from
the
flying
squirrels
stadium
.

the
owners
of
bowtie
manged
to
add
something
new
while
preserving
what
was
already
there
.

the
theatre
has
greatly
improved
the
surrounding
neighborhood
.

there
's
plenty
of
parking
,
and
i
've
never
had
an
issue
with
audience
members
who
wo
n't
stop
talking
or
answering
their
cellphones
.

best
of
all
,
there
are
no
ads
!!!!
!

just
previews
and
the
main
feature
.

expect
to
pay
full
price
,
and
the
theatres
themselves
are
on
the
small
side
.

but
if
you
like
going
to
the
movies
,
you
should
love
bowtie
.

the
mangers
also
play
a
classic
movies
on
sundays
,
you
can
get
a
beer
in
the
lobby
,
and
repeat
customers
can
get
discounts
if
they
have
a
member
card
.

a
great
cinema
in
a
great
location
.

thank
you
,
bowtie
!

craft
wonderland
with
history

my
first
visit
was
so
fun
yesterday
.

i
could
have
stayed
all
day
and
not
seen
all
the
things
.

i
am
doing
origami
jewelry
and
found
exactly
the
right
things
for
earrings
and
got
many
other
ideas
there
too
.

i
bought
a
beginner
s
quilling
set
and
like
making
the
filigree
forms
you
can
make
and
add
to
other
crafts
.

the
owner
,
jean
,
has
been
there
31
years
!

what
a
history
.

she
is
a
super
sweet
,
lovable
and
well
-
informed
woman
with
a
great
sense
of
humor
.

i
really
enjoyed
meeting
her
and
happy
to
learn
she
comes
from
oklahoma
and
has
the
values
of
a
solid
no
bs
country
girl
.

this
store
is
a
real
gem
and
has
much
to
offer
the
serious
crafter
or
the
occasional
crafter
.

by
the
way
,
salmagundi
(
the
store
name
)
means
something
like
smorgasbord
;
potpourri
;
motley
;
variety
;
mixed
bag
;
miscellaneous
assortment
;
mixture
,
a
variety
of
many
kinds
of
things
.

great
name
for
a
great
store

the
2010
genesis
is
grrrrrrrreeeaaat
!

i
am
a
proud
owner
of
a
brand
new
2010
hyundai
genesis
.

i
have
never
seen
this
car
before
until
this
lady
at
wal
mart
had
it
and
she
told
me
she
got
it
here
and
that
everyone
was
so
nice
to
her
.

i
asked
her
who
she
worked
with
and
she
just
told
me
ti
was
the
sales
manager
.

i
took
the
weekend
off
and
came
in
and
asked
for
the
manager
who
is
jeff
and
he
remembered
her
right
away
even
remembered
her
dog
,
i
was
a
bit
shocked
that
someone
would
pay
that
close
attention
.

we
got
to
talking
and
he
got
me
set
up
and
i
test
drove
with
craig
and
i
fell
head
over
heels
for
this
car
all
i
kept
saying
,
"
was
i
got
ta
have
it
!
"

i
thouhgt
it
would
be
out
of
my
price
range
but
they
really
worked
with
me
and
now
i
could
nt
be
happier
.

jeff
and
craig
are
really
good
at
what
they
do
and
know
exactly
how
to
treat
a
customer
.

definitely
go
see
them
!

bait
and
switch
,
untrained
workers

called
the
bonanza
store
2
weeks
ago
,
before
i
ripped
out
350
sq
ft
of
ceramic
tile
...
was
told
i
would
need
a
"
dual
head
concrete
grinder
"
to
remove
thinset
and
make
a
nice
"
finished
"
look
(
ready
for
concrete
stain
)
.

was
quoted
$
55
all
inclusive
of
grinder
inserts
,
etc
.

no
problem
,
sounded
like
it
's
done
every
day
.

will
look
beautiful
.

got
the
tile
ripped
out
,
call
today
,
now
all
the
sudden
this
grinder
wo
n't
leave
a
finished
look
and
it
's
$
125
plus
around
$
75
for
the
inserts
.

i
can
rent
another
machine
for
like
$
60
that
will
give
it
a
finished
look
.

so
from
$
55
to
$
260
?

are
they
serious
?

i
feel
like
they
did
n't
tell
me
the
pitfalls
before
i
pulled
out
this
tile
and
now
that
i
have
no
other
options
they
want
5
times
the
price
?

either
these
people
do
n't
know
anything
about
what
they
are
renting
,
or
worse
-
they
are
bait
and
switching
.

one
suspects
that
earlier
reviewer
works
for
another
laundry
.

outside
of
parking
being
at
a
premium
,
especially
on
discount
days
,
the
laundry
tub
is
not
filthy
and
it
's
no
smaller
than
any
of
a
dozen
laundromats
i
've
been
in
.

yes
,
there
are
bigger
,
but
bigger
is
n't
necessarily
better
.

i
availed
myself
of
the
wash
'n
fold
service
,
taking
just
about
a
year
's
worth
of
dirty
clothes
in
and
getting
back
neatly
folded
,
clean
clothes
in
clear
plastic
bags
(
i
'd
originally
brought
them
in
,
in
six
large
yellow
garbage
bags
)
.

the
cost
was
certainly
reasonable
and
i
will
continue
my
patronage
of
the
laundry
tub
in
the
future
.

did
n't
hurt
any
that
they
knew
my
name
by
my
second
visit
and
greeted
me
warmly
then
and
on
my
third
visit
.

whereas
my
answer
to
the
question
"
where
do
you
get
your
laundry
done
?
"
used
to
be
,
"
at
the
checkout
line
at
walmart
,
"
i
can
honestly
say
the
answer
now
is
,
"
at
the
laundry
tub
.
"

thank
you
!

i
recently
took
a
rescue
puppy
to
this
clinic
and
i
was
shocked
at
how
well
romeo
and
my
family
was
treated
.

they
worked
around
the
clock
to
ensure
that
my
puppy
life
was
saved
.

we
have
to
leave
him
at
the
vet
for
3
days
and
i
was
told
to
call
for
check
ups
as
often
as
i
wished
that
no
matter
how
many
times
i
called
i
would
not
annoy
them
.

lol
they
where
super
friendly
towards
us
and
treated
us
like
people
not
walking
bags
of
cash
.

in
this
day
it
s
rare
to
find
such
wonderful
people
who
care
,
not
the
kind
of
want
to
make
cash
.

i
would
strongly
suggest
you
give
them
the
chance
to
prove
to
you
that
not
all
people
in
this
world
are
evil
!

i
will
never
go
to
another
vet
as
long
as
i
have
animals
.

i
live
nearly
two
hours
away
and
yet
i
will
still
make
the
drive
to
see
them
!

in
fact
i
look
forward
to
taking
my
animals
to
the
vet
simply
because
of
how
my
animals
and
i
are
treated
.

okay
,
here
's
the
scoop
.

i
'm
a
regular
at
the
hh
.

the
food
is
excellent
,
the
serivce
is
horrible
.

i
think
they
're
still
in
the
mindset
from
when
it
was
only
smokers
sitting
around
and
drinking
...
not
in
any
hurry
.

in
my
experience
the
food
has
been
excellent
(
for
the
most
part
)
.

however
,
the
bartenders
/
waitresses
definately
need
to
be
re-trained
(
if
they
ever
had
any
to
begin
with
)
and
learn
two
things
:
only
chat
with
customers
when
other
customers
are
not
impatiently
waiting
and
to
look
around
more
often
to
see
if
people
are
waiting
.

in
some
cases
the
result
is
because
of
understaffing
,
in
some
cases
the
staff
just
does
n't
care
/
know
better
.

they
must
also
get
something
to
keep
take
-
out
warm
,
so
it
's
not
room
temperature
at
best
when
you
get
it
home
.

you
just
have
to
know
what
you
're
getting
into
when
you
go
.

nice
local
pub
,
excellent
food
(
especially
wings
)
,
and
do
n't
go
if
you
have
a
limited
amount
of
time
.

trust
the
midas
touch

i
personally
trust
this
midas
store
with
all
my
vehicles
,
i
have
been
going
there
for
years
&
would
never
go
anywhere
else
!

the
staff
is
very
personable
&
actually
care
about
the
customers
safety
rather
than
taking
there
money
.

this
is
however
a
very
busy
shop
but
there
are
appointments
available
&
the
staff
up
front
will
surely
make
sure
you
get
back
in
a
timely
manner
.

i
look
at
some
of
these
other
comments
&
laugh
because
people
think
that
the
world
revolves
around
them
!

like
the
girl
with
the
fuse
problem
...

midas
has
the
most
high
tech
equipment
in
town
&
i
guarantee
you
if
they
told
you
it
was
electrical
then
in
deed
it
s
electrical
!

maybe
you
should
understand
how
the
world
works
&
realize
you
are
just
like
any
other
person
&
not
put
yourself
on
a
pedestal
.

i
will
continue
going
to
dave
at
midas
because
he
is
one
of
the
most
honest
business
owners
in
this
town
!

when
having
your
car
worked
on
you
have
to
trust
the
mechanic
&
this
midas
is
truly
someone
you
can
trust
!

we
decided
to
try
this
place
last
night
because
we
noticed
that
it
had
some
interesting
things
on
the
menu
aside
from
the
usual
rolls
--
live
scallop
sashimi
,
duck
breast
nigiri
with
foie
gras
,
panko
mussels
--
but
none
of
these
were
particularly
great
or
worth
the
sticker
price
.

additionally
we
tried
the
logan
circle
roll
,
spicy
crab
and
tuna
roll
,
and
sweet
potato
tempura
roll
(
$
15
,
$
10
,
and
$
3.75
respectively
)
.

the
sweet
potato
tempura
roll
was
actually
a
great
surprise
:
cheap
and
delicious
,
the
only
thing
we
tried
that
i
would
say
was
well
worth
it
and
a
great
value
(
and
i
never
get
vegetarian
rolls
)
.

the
other
rolls
were
n't
at
all
special
,
especially
given
their
pricing
.

the
bottom
line
is
that
the
food
is
n't
great
and
is
relatively
high
-
priced
.

the
service
is
solicitous
,
the
atmosphere
is
nice
and
mod
except
the
out
-
of
-
place
flat
-
screen
tv
playing
football
.

but
i
'd
go
elsewhere
unless
the
prices
are
cut
.

it
's
just
not
worth
it
.

do
n't
expect
sleep
or
courtesy

i
was
booked
for
2
nights
at
this
hotel
in
oct
2007
.

at
3:15
am
on
night
2
,
the
fire
alarm
and
strobe
light
activated
in
my
room
.

these
are
not
household
type
alarms
.

when
they
sound
off
,
it
is
a
true
audio
/
visual
experience
.

i
called
the
front
desk
and
got
no
answer
.

after
checking
for
signs
of
fire
or
smoke
and
seeing
none
,
i
decided
to
just
pack
up
and
leave
.

the
desk
agent
actually
argued
with
me
,
claiming
that
no
such
alarm
had
gone
off
(
as
if
i
would
make
that
up
?
)
.

he
finally
admitted
that
only
the
4
ada
room
alarms
had
sounded
,
so
only
4
guests
were
effected
(
no
big
deal
to
him
)
.

this
little
drip
offered
no
apologies
whatsoever
,
and
even
refused
to
give
me
the
name
of
the
manager
until
i
pressed
him
for
it
3
times
.

this
hotel
is
adequate
enough
,
but
there
is
an
obvious
problem
with
the
staff
and
management
.

do
not
go
there
if
you
expect
to
sleep
through
the
night
.

poor
service
,
lack
of
passion
:
do
not
go

i
began
seeing
dr.
romanick
back
in
2000
and
have
seen
a
significant
decline
in
the
quality
of
care
,
patient
-
doctor
communication
,
and
just
the
overall
level
of
services
.

the
poor
quality
starts
at
the
receptionist
desk
,
where
the
staff
is
very
impatient
and
lack
the
efficiency
i
once
loved
about
the
office
.

it
took
them
nearly
two
months
to
complete
a
simple
task
,
and
countless
calls
from
my
part
due
to
their
lack
of
response
and
passion
(
not
that
it
's
a
requirement
for
the
job
,
but
it
helps
to
at
least
pretend
to
be
helpful
)
.

also
,
i
was
promised
to
have
my
test
results
emailed
to
me
,
but
it
never
happened
,
and
after
a
few
attempts
to
get
dr.
romanick
on
the
phone
to
brief
me
on
my
condition
,
i
finally
gave
up
and
went
to
a
different
doctor
.

please
do
not
go
there
if
it
's
professional
,
friendly
,
diligent
medical
services
you
're
looking
for
.

save
yourself
the
trouble
,
money
and
time
and
visit
a
more
caring
facility
/
doctor
.

the
moving
company
is
actualy
based
in
brooklyn
,
but
advertised
all
over
ny
/
nj
,
including
fort
lee
.

when
the
guys
arrived
(
2
hours
later
than
agreed
)
they
told
that
you
have
to
pay
all
the
tolls
they
payed
coming
from
brooklyn
and
extra
$
100
for
them
to
drive
back
from
your
destination
.

that
was
not
in
agreement
eather
,
but
they
realy
demand
it
.

and
another
$
100
for
wrapping
the
furniture
.

so
totalling
$
212
just
for
start
before
any
work
started
.

guess
what
,
was
not
in
the
initial
agreement
as
well
.

i
was
moving
out
from
2
bdr
apartment
and
it
took
for
3
strong
guys
6
hours
to
load
a
track
(
from
2
pm
-
8
pm
)
.

the
only
reason
i
'm
giving
3
stars
instead
of
1
or
2
,
i
should
admit
,
nothing
was
broken
.

so
i
still
can
recomend
them
but
prepare
pay
twice
as
much
as
they
tell
you
initially
.

one
more
thing
,
they
do
n't
take
any
credit
cards
or
checks
.

you
have
to
pay
cash
only
before
they
start
unloading
track
on
your
destination
.

worst
apartments
ever

we
lived
here
for
2
years
,
the
first
year
or
so
was
okay
.

then
,
the
more
power
they
gave
to
linda
,
the
worse
the
place
got
.

we
were
always
having
our
water
shut
off
,
there
were
always
people
having
parties
at
the
pool
,
even
after
it
was
supposed
to
be
closed
.

the
pool
was
supposed
to
close
at
10
and
they
would
have
people
down
there
until
11:45
yelling
,
playing
music
and
do
who
-
knows
-
what
in
the
dark
corners
of
the
pool
.

then
,
when
we
moved
out
,
we
cleaned
the
apartment
top
to
bottom
,
they
came
back
and
tried
to
charge
us
for
two
cleaning
fees
(
and
we
never
got
our
deposit
back
)
and
past
utilities
(
that
were
already
paid
,
we
have
check
numbers
and
records
of
this
)
.

linda
is
the
rudest
person
you
will
ever
talk
to
and
she
sticks
up
for
all
of
the
trashy
,
rude
people
that
live
there
,
not
the
nice
ones
that
actually
give
a
crap
about
respecting
others
.

do
not
live
here
,
you
will
regret
it
!

the
worst
experience
ever
!!!

i
have
worked
with
ted
jurek
at
decor
and
you
,
and
it
started
out
as
a
decent
experience
.

he
was
referred
to
me
by
a
friend
,
who
did
n't
have
the
best
experience
with
ted
,
but
said
that
ted
was
able
to
make
up
for
his
lack
of
preparedness
at
the
end
.

i
figure
i
would
give
this
company
a
chance
.

however
,
after
giving
a
required
$
500.00
(
non
refundable
)
deposit
before
seeing
any
plans
or
ideas
,
i
was
sorry
i
did
.

we
met
a
couple
of
weeks
later
,
ted
was
late
.

he
brought
fabric
books
,
and
pictures
of
furniture
only
,
which
all
came
way
over
budget
.

by
the
time
we
got
to
the
budget
i
told
him
i
could
work
with
,
there
was
basically
no
design
.

just
curtains
and
a
couple
of
accessories
.

what
is
that
?????

this
company
is
way
too
expensive
with
nothing
to
show
for
it
.

please
everyone
....
take
heed
and
do
n't
get
caught
up
in
the
hype
about
decor
and
you
working
with
every
budget
...

this
is
just
a
way
for
them
to
squirm
their
way
into
your
precious
pocket

horrible
.

horrible
.

when
we
walked
in
,
the
person
behind
desk
said
:
"
oh
well
,
you
must
wait
,
i
am
in
the
middle
of
something
.
"

after
a
good
few
minutes
,
he
asked
:
"
what
do
you
want
?
"

somewhere
in
between
his
rudeness
he
asked
if
we
smoked
.

i
asked
if
this
hotel
had
smoking
rooms
.

he
immediately
said
"
no
,
there
is
a
$
50
deposit
now
!
"

sure
enough
he
charged
it
to
the
credit
card
.

when
i
inquired
he
rudely
replied
"
in
the
morning
when
things
are
checked
out
you
'll
get
it
back
.
"

i
called
customer
service
about
it
because
the
website
specifically
states
that
there
are
no
other
charges
at
the
check
-
in
.

i
also
mentioned
to
the
reception
person
.

he
responded
"
we
have
problem
with
'
people
'
"
.

imagine
a
hotel
having
problems
with
people
.

i
finally
alerted
him
to
his
rudeness
.

he
said
he
's
had
a
long
and
bad
day
.

we
had
no
choice
but
to
stay
but
will
take
this
as
far
as
we
can
.

do
n't
stay
there
.

i
came
to
find
out
the
person
was
the
hotel
owner
also
.

my
friend
and
i
were
to
stay
here
for
a
girls
night
,
catch
up
on
our
lives
evening
.

we
live
within
20
miles
of
the
hotel
and
wanted
to
get
away
from
our
responsibilities
for
the
night
.

unfortunalty
my
husband
and
i
had
to
put
our
13
year
old
lab
down
that
morning
and
we
were
not
expecting
this
.

my
friend
called
the
hotel
to
cancel
our
room
as
soon
as
i
called
her
.

they
said
that
we
were
to
be
charged
for
this
room
regardless
because
we
did
not
cancel
within
the
72
hours
.

i
called
them
back
a
few
hours
after
putting
my
bodhi
down
and
they
still
would
n't
budge
.

times
are
hard
,
i
know
,
but
they
had
no
compassion
.

i
called
3
times
to
talked
to
a
manager
,
never
a
call
back
.

i
emailed
4
times
,
never
a
response
.

in
one
of
the
emails
i
attached
the
letter
from
the
vet
's
that
expressed
their
sympathy
,
this
hotel
did
nothing
.

i
even
emailed
mackinaw
tourist
and
nothing
.

i
am
sure
this
is
a
good
place
to
stay
from
reading
the
other
reviews
,
but
if
something
unexpected
happens
in
your
life
,
they
will
not
care
.

fanfuckingtastic

ok
i
am
a
new
yorker
who
has
been
going
to
school
in
oxford
,
england
.

i
thought
the
uk
was
completely
devoid
of
good
nyc
style
pizza
.

i
thought
to
get
a
decent
pizza
the
only
way
was
at
a
fancy
restaurant
,
and
i
have
to
get
a
whole
pie
.

i
thought
i
would
have
to
wait
until
i
went
home
to
nyc
.

well
then
i
went
on
a
trip
to
glasgow
and
was
walking
around
.

i
saw
this
place
and
it
looked
like
the
holy
grail
.

i
knew
i
had
found
the
real
deal
,
big
pies
,
sold
by
the
slice
,
with
the
pizzas
sitting
under
the
glass
in
the
front
.

they
have
crushed
red
pepper
flakes
and
oregano
.

so
i
ordered
a
slice
.

it
tasted
like
i
just
flew
back
home
.

i
du
n
no
how
they
did
it
,
but
scottish
friends
---
this
is
the
real
deal
.

i
congratulated
this
establishment
for
doing
the
research
on
making
nyc
pizza
because
these
scots
fcking
nailed
it
.

that
being
said
,
i
do
n't
know
how
their
delivery
service
is
.

they
might
want
to
change
the
name
to
reflect
the
new
yorkedness
of
the
pizza
,
scrummy
yummy
sounds
gimmicky
to
me
.

good
food
,
good
wait
staff
,
poor
management

we
visited
on
7/26/08
for
dinner
we
received
a
gift
certificate
for
the
mama
mia
's
on
greenfield
ave
.

the
food
was
good
,
and
so
was
our
waitress
.

when
it
came
time
to
pay
the
bill
up
front
,
they
would
not
let
me
use
any
of
the
certificate
for
a
tip
(
which
i
have
done
with
any
other
restaurant
i
've
gotten
a
gift
certificate
for
.
)

i
then
asked
if
i
could
have
money
back
in
cash
.

the
person
went
to
go
check
with
the
manager
,
who
was
sitting
at
a
table
chatting
with
her
friends
who
were
eating
there
.

her
answer
was
short
and
manner
rather
rude
.

sorry
for
interrupting
i
guess
.

the
cashier
was
also
short
,
unapologetic
and
made
me
feel
as
i
was
wasting
her
time
.

there
were
no
other
options
available
(
i
only
brought
my
check
card
to
cover
any
overage
cost
)
and
she
rang
it
up
and
applied
it
to
the
gift
card
before
telling
me
about
the
tip
policy
.

i
will
not
be
visiting
mama
mia
's
again
.

there
are
other
places
with
food
just
as
good
with
management
that
values
customers
and
employees
much
more
.

dining
at
texas
roadhouse

texas
roadhouse
has
very
good
meals
,
that
the
meat
comes
right
off
the
bones
.

it
has
very
good
prices
.

on
a
bad
note
the
waiting
area
is
not
enjoyable
or
enough
seats
.

also
,
there
should
not
be
peanuts
all
over
the
floor
.

next
,
there
should
only
be
one
person
bringing
you
your
food
.

it
s
not
a
big
deal
but
i
had
to
take
my
salad
home
because
they
forgot
to
bring
it
.

i
had
to
ask
the
girl
who
brought
my
food
and
she
never
came
back
to
let
me
know
.

i
had
to
wait
for
my
waitress
.

when
you
first
come
in
the
hostess
is
not
very
friendly
,
there
is
just
a
bunch
of
workers
standing
there
.

i
was
there
on
march
6th
,
2009
.

i
was
also
there
of
july
4th
2008
,
when
my
daughter
s
buffalo
wings
came
out
with
a
fly
on
it
.

the
manager
came
over
and
said
he
was
sorry
and
gave
a
new
batch
of
wings
,
he
said
we
ca
nt
really
do
anything
because
the
doors
are
always
opening
and
closing
.

in
my
opinion
should
of
just
took
off
the
price
of
the
wings
from
the
bill
.

but
everyone
has
there
own
way
!!!!!!

mezza
luna
ftw
!

their
mezza
luna's
are
deffly
better
than
the
pizza
rolls
.

it
s
like
a
pizza
roll
,
but
they
just
toss
ham
and
cheese
inside
.

it
seems
like
it
s
healthier
too
,
but
it
s
prolly
not
.

also
,
you
can
call
em
ahead
of
time
,
and
then
go
to
pick
up
ur
food
,
or
have
it
delivered
**
.

that
cuts
down
on
teh
wait
time
,
cus
u
can
do
other
stuff
while
u
r
waiting
.

it
usually
takes
20
mins
for
a
mezza
luna
,
as
they
have
to
add
pure
delicious
extract
to
the
mix
.

their
pizza
was
a
little
salty
for
me
,
but
it
s
still
good
.

they
do
that
whole
thing
where
you
sandwich
the
pepperoni
between
layers
of
cheese
for
+
32
delicious
.

anyways
,
the
mezza
luna
:
you
should
try
it
.

it
runs
you
about
4
bucks
and
it
deals
crushing
blows
to
hunger
.

**
edit
:
living
on
campus
at
clarkson
university
,
i
have
had
food
delivered
before
.

this
was
back
between
'05
and
'09
and
i
do
n't
remember
how
many
times
we
've
had
it
delivered
.

perhaps
they
do
n't
deliver
anymore
,
but
the
deliciousness
of
a
mezza
luna
certainly
warrants
a
pickup
.

my
2004
x
-
type
was
getting
close
to
100,000
miles
so
it
was
time
for
an
upgrade
.

i
sent
my
wife
and
daughter
over
to
check
out
a
pre-owned
2009
xf
.

michael
chestney
was
very
pleasant
and
patient
with
my
wife
and
she
suggested
i
go
check
it
out
.

i
went
in
later
that
afternoon
and
met
with
michael
.

he
showed
me
the
car
i
was
interested
in
and
we
took
a
test
drive
.

i
loved
the
car
so
we
began
negotiating
my
trade
-
in
and
the
price
of
the
09
xf
.

the
entire
negotiation
took
about
20
minutes
.

fair
give
and
take
on
both
sides
until
we
agreed
on
a
deal
that
was
within
my
parameters
and
was
fair
to
both
sides
.

10
minutes
of
paperwork
and
i
was
the
owner
of
a
beautiful
pre-owned
09
xf
.

i
have
purchased
over
15
vehicles
(
cars
,
rvs
,
and
boats
)
in
my
lifetime
and
i
have
to
say
the
experience
with
michael
and
barrett
motor
cars
of
san
antonio
was
one
of
the
best
.

friendly
,
knowledgeable
,
and
above
all
fair
.

that
's
all
you
can
really
ask
from
a
car
dealer
and
michael
and
barrett
hit
all
3
.

thanks
for
the
great
deal
and
the
great
car
!

identity
theft

myself
and
my
fiance
's
identity
was
stolen
from
the
office
staff
.

we
were
told
by
a
detective
and
asked
to
check
our
credit
for
anything
unusual
.

luckily
they
caught
the
crooks
before
they
did
one
on
us
.

it
was
a
black
female
that
use
to
work
in
the
office
.

she
stole
the
information
and
gave
it
to
another
guy
that
did
all
the
work
.

the
other
guy
was
pulled
over
one
day
and
a
cop
saw
suspicious
papers
with
names
and
social
security
numbers
on
it
.

that
s
how
they
were
caught
.

they
both
went
to
jail
and
a
new
manager
was
put
in
charge
of
the
apartments
.

the
apartment
across
from
mine
belonged
to
a
gang
of
hookers
.

nobody
lived
there
.

a
girl
would
show
up
,
then
a
guy
in
a
nice
car
would
show
up
.

short
time
later
the
guy
would
leave
,
then
the
girl
.

my
apartment
was
usually
quiet
.

i
lived
in
one
that
did
not
face
the
parking
lot
.

parking
spaces
are
just
big
enough
for
a
mini
cooper
.

it
sucked
having
an
suv
.

if
i
found
a
spot
,
i
could
nt
fit
in
it
.

gates
worked
30
%
of
the
time
at
best
.

bugs
were
a
small
problem
,
nothing
too
bad
.

the
best
there
is
in
service
.

i
was
recently
traveling
down
i
-
24
from
nashville
with
my
3
young
children
and
had
a
blowout
on
the
southeast
side
of
murfreesboro
.

it
was
4:50
when
a
friend
told
me
to
call
bud
,
he
would
take
care
of
me
.

not
only
did
they
answer
the
phone
at
4:50
on
a
thursday
,
they
hit
the
ground
moving
!.

they
tracked
down
the
only
tire
that
fit
my
bmw
330i
in
murfreesboro
within
minutes
and
secured
it
,
then
they
came
out
,
took
off
my
tire
(
it
was
a
runflat
-
but
runflats
do
n't
do
you
any
good
if
they
blow
out
)
,
and
brought
it
to
their
shop
to
change
the
tire
.

they
were
back
quickly
considering
how
far
outside
of
murfreesboro
we
were
and
had
us
on
our
way
by
6:30
that
evening
.

thanks
bud
for
all
of
your
help
and
taking
time
away
from
your
family
that
evening
.

it
's
without
a
doubt
,
the
best
service
experience
i
've
ever
had
and
just
to
be
clear
,
the
price
he
charged
me
was
the
same
as
my
tire
guy
in
nashville
's
price
for
putting
on
the
other
rear
tire
.

i
hope
i
can
return
the
favor
in
the
future
!

service
and
client
base
not
ok
.

i
have
stayed
in
this
hotel
many
times
,
and
while
it
typically
offers
a
decent
bang
for
the
buck
,
its
client
base
largely
consists
of
troubled
youngsteers
and
evictees
from
the
local
,
not
so
pleasant
hood
.

i
have
never
considered
this
a
real
problem
as
i
travel
without
kids
and
can
fend
for
myself
,
but
when
i
had
to
listen
to
a
(
non-violent
)
domestic
fight
that
lasted
from
1
am
to
5
am
during
my
last
stay
and
i
found
out
that
the
front
desk
was
unmanned
during
night
hours
,
my
choice
was
to
either
waste
tax
payers
money
by
calling
for
a
yet
another
police
dispatch
to
this
hotel
,
or
just
get
over
it
.

i
chose
the
later
,
but
approached
the
front
desk
about
the
hotel
policy
to
push
over
their
responsibilities
on
local
authorities
,
not
to
mention
the
good
night
s
sleep
i
paid
for
but
did
nt
get
.

i
was
told
management
would
call
me
back
but
still
waiting
for
that
call
.

i
will
probably
stay
here
again
because
it
s
cheap
and
i
ca
nt
afford
a
better
hotel
,
but
do
not
look
forward
to
it
and
would
definitely
not
recommend
this
hotel
for
families
or
single
female
travellers
.

was
there
this
past
weekend
and
the
guy
behind
the
counter
yelled
at
me
and
my
son
because
we
believed
he
left
the
grandma
slice
in
the
oven
a
little
too
long
and
the
cheese
got
all
dried
out
and
the
slice
tasted
more
like
a
cracker
.

he
preceded
to
grab
the
slice
off
the
countertop
and
throw
it
into
the
trash
while
yelling
at
me
saying
,
"
you
do
not
order
what
you
do
not
know
about
"
and
"
you
do
n't
know
how
pizza
is
made
"
.

it
was
very
upsetting
to
see
this
kind
of
behavior
especially
in
front
of
my
four
year
old
.

he
was
in
the
process
of
making
me
a
pie
and
when
i
got
home
,
the
pie
was
the
worst
i
have
ever
seen
.

cheese
was
falling
off
,
so
oily
and
greasy
.

i
think
he
did
it
on
purpose
because
of
my
simple
request
for
another
slice
of
grandma
that
was
n't
so
well
-
done
(
actually
,
burnt
)
.

i
will
never
go
back
to
this
place
and
i
am
reporting
them
to
the
better
business
bureau
for
such
horrible
customer
relations
and
basically
sabotaging
my
pizza
and
taking
my
$
25
.

this
story
is
100
%
true
.

that
little
man
who
thinks
he
invented
pizza
can
kiss
my
*ss
.

long
lines
,
silly
rules
,
rude
staff
,
ok
food

the
first
thing
you
notice
when
you
arrive
on
location
is
that
the
waiting
line
literally
goes
out
the
door
and
spills
into
the
parking
lot
.

a
restaurant
with
this
many
patrons
willing
to
stand
in
line
just
to
order
tacos
must
be
good
,
right
?

i
mean
,
that
's
the
way
it
works
at
amusement
parks
:
the
longest
lines
are
at
the
best
rides
.

well
,
this
may
be
an
exception
.

the
staff
taking
your
order
and
"
waiting
"
on
you
are
very
indifferent
and
have
no
sense
of
costumer
service
at
all
.

i
have
gotten
better
results
talking
to
comcast
customer
service
than
with
these
folks
.

and
do
n't
even
think
about
asking
to
speak
to
the
manager
because
this
guy
is
,
and
pardon
my
french
,
a
jerk
.

if
you
have
gotten
through
ordering
,
dealing
with
the
rude
staff
and
if
you
followed
the
dumb
rules
,
you
are
finally
presented
with
what
you
came
for
..
some
tacos
that
are
"
ok
,
"
but
definitely
not
worth
putting
up
with
all
the
hassle
.

save
yourself
the
trouble
and
skip
this
place
all
together
.

i
suggest
you
go
up
to
raging
taco
&
raging
burrito
a
couple
of
blocks
up
the
street
or
even
taco
mac
.

wish
this
was
in
saratoga
--

we
were
introduced
to
bistro
tallulah
by
traveler
-
professional
diner
who
happens
to
own
the
adelphi
hotel
and
travels
the
world
--
and
residing
in
paris
,
london
,
new
york
the
rest
of
the
year
.

she
knows
great
food
and
dining
experiences
.

she
was
dead
on
--
this
restaurant
was
wonderful
---
do
not
be
put
off
by
the
one
negative
review
on
this
page
.

i
can
tell
you
we
were
pleasantly
surprised
--
bt
has
taste
memory
and
each
time
back
the
food
was
consistently
delicious
--
same
dishes
--
were
consistent
.

our
friend
is
a
world
traveler
and
loves
unpretentious
dining
experiences
and
inspired
food
.

this
chef
knows
what
he
is
doing
.

treat
yourself
and
go
--
you
will
go
back
!

i
am
a
business
owner
in
downtown
saratoga
springs
and
wish
this
restaurant
was
in
our
town
!

the
affordable
rent
makes
it
possible
for
an
inspired
chef
to
serve
his
high
quality
fare
at
affordable
prices
!

unlike
saratoga
.

i
rrly
seek
the
cehf
out
to
introduce
myself
--
but
the
second
time
we
went
--
i
made
a
point
of
asking
our
wait
person
to
introduce
my
friend
and
myself
to
the
chef
to
tell
him
just
how
good
our
meals
were
.

can
not
wait
to
go
gain

of

if

they

call
back
a
month
later
so
you
can
then
make
one
.

they
also
do
n't
tell
you
that
they
're
going
to
mail
you
an
"
application
"
to
be
admitted
to
be
a
patient
.

i
feel
that
the
way
some
doctor
s
offices
work
around
here
is
a
little
bit
absurd
so
i
'm
happy
that
these
guys
do
n't
do
those
two
things
in
particlular
.

usually
you
can
be
seen
the
same
week
or
maybe
the
following
week
.

the
doctor
did
tell
me
that
my
male
pattern
baldness
is
due
to
my
mother
s
father
because
the
gene
is
exclusively
passed
on
through
maternal
line
but
that
's
a
common
misconception
(
http://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-living/beauty-personal-care/hair-loss-10-08/hair-loss.htm
)
.

in
general
i
would
say
that
the
staff
is
attentive
and
nice
.

but
then
again
i
was
nice
to
them
so
that
could
have
been
why
.

anyhow
,
after
reading
some
of
the
other
reviews
it
seems
like
some
of
the
other
reviewers
are
expecting
mircles
.

if
you
want
miracles
you
'll
have
to
go
to
21st
st
.

it
's
a
pretty
typical
primary
care
office
but
for
the
area
it
's
very
good
.

they
do
n't
do
certain
things
that
are
really
annoying
about
other
offices
.

first
trip
to
canada

i
recently
traveled
to
canada
on
business
and
had
a
most
excellent
experience
.

i
work
for
a
large
retail
company
recently
expanding
our
operations
into
canada
and
had
to
travel
to
ensure
all
of
our
computer
network
equipment
was
installed
properly
and
on
time
.

this
can
tend
to
be
a
stressful
experience
in
itself
let
alone
adding
crossing
boarders
for
the
first
time
.

i
was
very
pleased
to
find
my
accommodations
and
the
hotel
staff
to
be
a
very
calming
and
comforting
part
of
my
trip
.

i
found
the
hotel
to
be
amazingly
clean
,
not
to
mention
very
well
adorned
with
many
pleasant
surprises
.

from
my
first
encounter
at
check
in
to
my
regrettable
check
out
i
found
the
staff
and
facility
to
exceed
my
expectation
.

i
completely
enjoyed
my
whole
check
in
experience
and
was
impressed
with
the
friendliness
and
professionalism
of
the
staff
as
well
as
the
accommodations
themselves
.

i
will
be
traveling
in
this
area
in
the
future
and
you
can
be
assured
that
this
experience
will
be
helpful
in
my
choice
of
hotels
and
novotel
will
be
my
first
selection
.

yes
the
parking
can
be
a
challenge
but
being
from
nj
i
am
no
stranger
to
tight
corners
.

please
pass
my
appreciation
to
the
staff
and
management
for
their
excellent
hospitality
and
good
spirits
as
it
helped
make
a
stressful
trip
enjoyable
.

favorite
place
in
tampa
.

update
:
i
had
to
add
to
my
review
.

i
was
just
in
last
night
and
had
a
chance
to
dine
in
their
new
dining
room
.

amazing
!

i
frequent
this
resturant
on
a
weekly
basis
but
usally
only
for
lunch
.

well
i
was
in
for
a
treat
when
i
was
greeted
by
the
friendly
girls
at
the
counter
who
asked
if
my
wife
and
i
would
like
to
sit
in
their
"
new
"
dining
room
.

right
away
they
told
us
that
it
was
the
same
great
food
with
the
same
prices
so
off
we
went
.

we
were
greeted
again
and
sat
promptly
.

after
looking
at
the
menu
and
seeing
the
new
menu
items
they
had
,
we
knew
we
were
in
for
a
treat
!

i
had
the
chicken
parmesan
dinner
and
my
wife
had
the
shrimp
scampi
dinner
.

amazing
!

the
portions
were
generous
enough
that
we
even
took
some
home
!

i
have
to
say
the
value
of
this
place
always
amazes
me
.

it
's
nice
to
see
that
even
in
the
economy
we
can
eat
a
place
that
has
upscale
service
,
amazing
atmosphere
,
and
incredible
food
,
but
not
break
the
bank
while
enjoying
it
!

bottom
line
is
that
when
it
's
a
small
privatly
owned
resturant
like
this
is
you
can
tell
that
the
owners
and
employees
take
pride
in
their
product
and
service
.

well
done
!

great
work
and
honest
establishment
!

i
typically
have
work
done
on
my
jeep
at
the
dealership
,
but
it
is
6
years
old
now
and
getting
charged
dealership
prices
just
did
n't
seem
cost
effective
anymore
.

i
had
tried
out
few
place
around
the
area
and
had
been
ripped
off
a
few
times
.

i
had
hear
great
things
about
phet
and
g&g
automotive
so
i
decided
to
give
him
a
try
.

the
service
was
excellent
and
personable
.

he
checked
out
what
i
needed
to
have
done
told
me
what
needed
be
fixed
before
he
did
any
work
and
did
great
repair
work
.

the
price
was
actually
lower
than
what
i
had
anticipated
and
used
to
compared
to
other
places
,
plus
he
showed
me
the
work
he
did
when
i
came
in
to
pick
up
the
car
.

also
,
a
week
after
the
work
,
phet
called
me
up
to
see
how
my
car
was
running
and
to
let
me
know
that
they
had
accidentally
overcharged
me
for
part
of
the
work
and
wanted
to
give
me
a
refund
for
that
amount
.

that
is
just
unheard
of
these
days
!

i
grew
up
in
a
small
town
where
you
knew
and
trusted
your
mechanic
and
was
really
cynical
about
city
auto
repair
shops
since
i
moved
here
,
but
phet
has
shown
that
there
really
are
honest
hard
working
mechanics
around
.

he
is
my
mechanic
going
forward
!

our
company
is
a
high
end
designer
handbag
and
fashion
accessories
company
,
thus
we
are
certainly
a
niche
market
.

we
had
been
evaluating
seo
providers
for
quite
some
time
and
finally
decided
to
take
the
plunge
with
stuart
,
and
ulistic
.

we
made
the
decision
for
a
couple
of
reasons
.

1
.
social
media
.

we
were
familiar
with
search
engine
optimization
strategies
,
but
new
nothing
about
social
media
-
we
just
heard
that
it
was
the
next
big
thing
.

2
.
we
really
liked
the
fact
that
stuart
sets
defined
objectives
and
we
meet
once
a
month
to
go
over
our
key
performance
indicators
.

how
has
it
gone
so
far
?

well
we
have
been
working
with
ulistic
for
1.5
months
,
and
have
100
people
following
our
site
on
facebook
,
and
our
web
site
,
www.designofashion.com
has
seen
a
3
fold
increase
in
traffic
,
which
is
significantly
beating
our
expectations
-
seo
is
a
process
that
takes
time
and
to
get
results
this
quickly
is
exceptional
.

we
are
absolutely
confident
that
stuart
's
ethical
and
focused
strategies
will
see
these
trends
continue
to
grow
,
and
our
business
will
reap
the
rewards
of
this
program
.

finally
,
it
must
be
said
that
stuart
is
a
fantastic
person
to
work
with
,
because
of
his
solid
strategies
and
equally
as
importantly
because
he
is
a
genuinely
good
person
and
a
great
communicator
.

excellent
service
and
quality

i
had
hom
-
excel
replace
most
of
the
windows
in
my
tampa
residence
three
years
ago
.

the
excellent
windows
have
performed
without
any
problems
,
but
that
's
not
why
i
'm
writing
my
review
.

three
weeks
ago
,
burglars
tried
to
gain
entry
into
the
rear
of
my
home
.

the
intruders
slit
the
screen
of
the
window
.

next
,
they
tried
to
force
the
window
with
a
pry
bar
and
then
to
break
the
window
with
a
hammer
.

the
window
did
n't
break
!

my
next
-
door
neighbor
heard
the
noise
and
turned
on
a
light
,
thankfully
scaring
the
two
miscreants
away
(
they
even
left
their
hammer
behind
!
)
.

i
called
home
-
excel
the
next
day
to
order
a
replacement
screen
for
the
window
,
and
was
happily
surprised
when
they
said
that
they
were
n't
even
going
to
charge
me
for
the
replacement
screen
...
that
it
would
be
covered
under
their
guarentee
.

lo
and
behold
,
they
replaced
the
screen
(
which
had
to
be
ordered
)
yesterday
and
did
n't
charge
me
a
dime
.

their
worker
even
cleaned
3
of
my
windows
and
changed
a
lightbulb
for
me
.

in
this
day
and
age
,
it
is
so
rare
to
find
a
company
with
such
nice
workers
and
such
far
ranging
guarantee
policies
.

i
rarely
write
reviews
such
as
this
one
,
but
they
certainly
deserve
anyone
's
business
!

friendly
staff
,
but
definitely
some
problems

may
,
2009
.

we
were
booked
at
the
sheraton
with
a
number
of
other
out
-
of
-
town
wedding
guests
.

got
put
into
the
wrong
room
the
first
night
,
and
were
quite
surprised
to
have
someone
with
the
same
room
key
trying
to
get
in
the
door
at
1:00
am
!

next
day
got
moved
into
another
room
,
on
the
same
floor
with
other
wedding
guests
.

there
were
3
adults
in
our
room
but
towels
for
only
2
,
no
linens
for
sofa
bed
.

in
the
second
room
it
took
3
tries
to
get
all
the
towels
and
linens
we
requested
.

a
package
and
some
wedding
cards
were
left
in
our
first
room
.

they
were
sent
to
our
second
room
and
had
been
opened
--
the
ribbon
-
wrapped
present
,
and
all
3
envelopes
.

security
in
the
hotel
seemed
to
be
excellent
,
but
we
were
never
given
an
explanation
as
to
why
someone
would
open
these
items
.

a
mid-afternoon
"
fire
drill
"
was
disruptive
,
putting
everyone
out
of
the
hotel
.

when
we
called
the
front
desk
about
an
extremely
boisterous
crowd
in
the
hall
outside
our
door
quite
late
at
night
,
it
seemed
to
take
the
hotel
staff
quite
a
while
to
quiet
them
down
.

the
staff
was
friendly
,
especially
the
front
desk
female
supervisor
,
and
seemed
to
want
to
help
,
but
too
many
unusual
things
happened
to
make
us
want
to
stay
there
again
.

be
careful
of
who
your
sales
guy
is

i
think
this
place
is
probably
really
great
especially
judging
by
the
reviews
on
here
.

my
experience
was
awful
though
.

it
all
had
to
do
with
the
sales
guy
which
was
a
young
22
year
old
who
had
admittedly
only
been
working
for
2
weeks
.

i
was
extremely
interested
in
the
car
and
very
likely
would
have
bought
it
,
but
the
sales
guy
i
dealt
with
ruined
the
deal
.

essentially
,
i
told
him
i
did
n't
trust
him
cause
he
was
a
car
salesman
,
but
he
got
so
incredibly
offended
at
that
statement
that
he
had
to
go
cry
to
another
salesman
and
compose
himself
before
coming
back
.

i
do
n't
know
if
the
kid
had
a
bad
day
or
what
,
but
i
had
to
sit
and
apologize
about
nothing
for
10
minutes
until
he
dropped
the
issue
.

after
that
,
i
just
tried
to
ignore
his
lack
of
professionalism
and
test
drive
the
car
.

i
played
dumb
and
asked
him
questions
that
i
already
knew
the
answers
to
and
he
responded
with
half
truths
and
a
few
falsehoods
.

for
instance
i
asked
who
owned
mazda
and
he
said
with
confidence
that
was
gm
,
which
is
n't
true
.

i
mean
,
i
do
n't
care
if
he
does
n't
know
,
but
if
he
pretends
to
know
and
tells
me
bs
to
my
face
,
there
's
no
way
i
'm
going
to
trust
him
when
matters
turn
to
the
price
of
the
car
and
financing
.

the
worst
chinese
i
've
ever
had

this
is
by
far
the
worst
chinese
food
i
have
ever
had
.

the
service
stunk
.

i
called
in
my
order
and
upon
arriving
to
pick
it
up
,
they
got
my
order
confused
with
someone
else
s
.

they
helped
about
three
other
people
before
they
offered
to
help
me
again
.

they
also
got
my
friend
s
order
mixed
up
and
wanted
to
charger
her
$
10
more
than
what
she
had
wanted
.

she
asked
for
the
dinner
combo
and
they
gave
her
two
dinner
plates
instead
.

we
were
standing
in
the
store
for
20
minutes
to
simply
pick
up
an
order
.

not
to
mention
that
the
wait
staff
was
about
as
pleasant
as
dealing
with
an
angry
bull
.

they
were
abrasive
and
rude
-
when
they
were
the
ones
who
messed
everything
up
.

we
had
to
throw
out
about
80
percent
of
our
meals
because
the
food
tasted
so
horrible
.

i
do
nt
know
how
it
is
possible
to
make
orange
chicken
,
sesame
chicken
and
kung
pao
chicken
as
well
as
cheese
puffs
taste
that
bad
but
china
delight
accomplished
that
.

the
only
thing
that
was
edible
was
the
steamed
rice
and
the
vegetable
lo
mein
was
barely
tolerable
.

i
will
never
go
here
again
.

lucky
panda
in
willis
is
a
billion
times
better
in
service
and
quality
of
the
meal
.

i
have
no
idea
how
china
delight
won
number
1
chinese
restaurant
in
montgomery
-
there
needs
to
be
a
recount
on
that
vote
.

terrible
service

one
of
the
worst
experiences
i
've
ever
had
with
a
auto
repair
shop
.

we
took
our
vehicle
in
for
a
repair
to
the
air
conditioning
.

approx
4
months
later
,
the
compressor
went
out
.

we
took
it
back
in
to
have
it
repaired
again
,
and
less
than
a
week
later
the
second
compressor
went
out
.

we
went
in
for
a
third
visit
and
they
fixed
it
again
,
but
this
time
when
we
picked
up
the
car
,
the
radio
and
clock
did
not
work
.

so
for
the
4th
time
in
5
months
and
the
third
time
in
2
weeks
,
we
brought
the
car
back
again
.

when
we
expressed
our
discontent
to
the
manager
(
that
's
right
,
the
manager
)
,
did
he
say
he
would
return
some
money
,
did
he
say
he
would
give
a
discount
on
our
next
visit
,
did
he
just
say
"
i
'm
sorry
"
.

nope
,
none
of
the
above
.

he
stood
there
and
told
us
how
he
was
n't
at
fault
.

it
was
the
fault
of
the
parts
supplier
,
and
can
we
imagine
how
he
felt
having
to
put
another
2
hours
of
work
in
the
car
.

and
what
did
we
expect
...
that
he
bench
test
every
part
.

at
no
time
during
the
conversation
did
the
words
,
"
i
'm
sorry
"
ever
come
out
of
his
mouth
.

i
,
nor
anyone
else
in
my
family
,
will
ever
go
to
sun
devil
auto
again
.

well
,
unless
of
course
the
third
compressor
he
put
in
the
car
goes
out
.

do
not
use
this
company
!

i
dropped
off
a
sheet
metal
piece
that
i
needed
copied
due
to
th
it
was
needing
to
be
replaced
.

i
asked
if
they
could
copy
the
piece
i
dropped
off
.

they
said
it
would
be
made
exactly
like
the
one
i
needed
to
replace
.

i
picked
it
up
when
it
was
finished
and
was
charge
30.00
.

when
i
got
to
the
job
and
tried
to
insert
the
new
piece
of
metal
it
would
not
fit
!!

i
took
the
original
piece
of
metal
and
rigged
it
to
make
due
since
i
had
to
complete
the
job
.

i
took
the
receipt
and
the
metal
that
did
not
fit
and
asked
pomper
for
my
money
back
.

the
girl
at
the
desk
was
sooo
rude
i
could
not
believe
it
!

she
told
me
she
could
not
use
the
piece
i
was
returning
and
the
company
would
only
put
it
in
the
trash
so
i
could
not
return
it
.

i
explained
i
did
not
get
what
i
paid
for
.

she
asked
me
to
bring
the
original
piece
back
and
i
told
her
i
had
to
use
it
on
the
job
.

she
told
me
that
was
to
bad
she
would
do
nothing
to
help
me
since
she
could
not
use
or
resell
the
piece
.

i
said
i
was
going
to
trash
it
also
and
could
i
at
least
have
a
credit
.

with
a
smirk
on
her
face
she
told
me
no
money
is
being
returned
and
that
is
the
way
it
was
.

do
not
use
this
company
.

there
are
to
many
people
that
need
our
business
to
have
to
put
up
with
this
unfair
treatment
!!!!!

i
would
never
recommend
this
gym
to
anyone
and
unfortunately
this
is
based
solely
on
the
owner
's
own
unprofessionalism
.

when
i
originally
joined
in
january
i
only
did
so
because
i
was
told
i
would
be
able
to
cancel
the
12
month
membership
if
i
was
to
move
away
.

i
signed
up
with
one
of
the
staff
who
was
very
pleasant
and
professional
.

actually
working
out
there
was
good
-
the
machines
are
nice
and
the
classes
are
fun
.

the
locker
room
is
certainly
lacking
-
i
would
never
shower
or
change
there
.

they
need
to
update
the
locker
rooms
asap
.

back
to
my
poor
rating
-
i
was
excepted
to
medical
school
and
went
in
to
cancel
my
membership
as
i
was
told
i
could
do
since
i
was
moving
away
.

the
owner
was
very
rude
,
accused
me
of
not
reading
my
contract
,
and
basically
told
me
to
shut
up
when
i
was
trying
to
ask
questions
to
further
understand
the
process
of
canceling
my
membership
.

i
was
able
to
cancel
it
but
only
after
paying
a
$
50
fee
(
which
the
staff
person
who
signed
me
up
stated
i
would
not
have
to
pay
if
i
had
proof
of
moving
)
and
being
spoken
to
in
a
very
belittling
manner
.

i
would
understand
if
i
was
being
treated
this
way
by
a
staff
member
but
the
club
's
actual
owner
?!

bad
for
business
.

i
was
appalled
.

i
will
never
recommend
this
gym
to
any
woman
.

the
equipment
and
classes
are
n't
good
enough
to
deal
with
the
rudeness
from
the
staff
!!!

there
are
better
places
on
the
cape
-

the
salon
experience
from
hell

i
feel
obligated
to
share
this
story
.

right
out
of
college
i
called
the
salon
and
explained
my
situation
.

just
graduated
,
just
moved
,
not
rich
,
and
starting
new
job
soon
.

i
never
got
a
price
quote
over
the
phone
and
they
take
your
cc
info
just
to
make
the
appointment
because
if
you
do
n't
show
up
,
they
'll
charge
you
.

i
had
this
ridiculous
celebrity
stylist
from
la
named
derrick
.

after
he
already
put
product
on
my
hair
he
said
"
i
should
warn
you
,
i
'm
expensive
.
"

what
was
i
supposed
to
do
,
say
i
ca
n't
afford
you
and
walk
out
with
crap
all
over
my
hair
.

i
wanted
to
be
very
blonde
and
instead
he
pulled
my
root
color
throughout
my
whole
hair
which
is
a
gross
mousey
brown
.

the
other
stylists
around
me
kept
pressuring
me
saying
he
's
so
wonderful
,
you
're
going
to
love
your
hair
.

$
400
later
my
jaw
dropped
when
the
receptionist
told
me
the
total
.

derrick
did
a
terrible
job
,
was
a
complete
jerk
the
entire
time
,
and
i
had
no
warning
as
to
the
price
.

i
cried
the
entire
way
home
.

he
then
"
fixed
"
it
for
free
but
it
still
looked
like
crap
.

i
will
never
go
back
.

it
was
the
salon
experience
from
absolutely
hell
.

he
also
told
me
that
he
worked
on
the
cast
of
will
and
grace
and
that
they
were
all
jerks
.

that
's
my
favorite
show
of
all
time
.

i
'm
pretty
sure
for
the
cast
that
it
was
the
other
way
around
.

maybe
he
did
n't
do
a
good
job
and
they
told
him
so
.

absolute
nightmare
!

stay
away
!

very
unhappy
...

working
with
rod
jacobsen
was
my
first
experience
working
with
a
cpa
,
so
i
did
not
know
what
to
expect
.

that
said
-
he
seemed
to
be
doing
well
enough
.

however
,
then
i
asked
to
amend
my
return
to
apply
a
credit
i
had
just
become
eligible
for
.

i
expected
to
pay
for
this
service
,
but
imagine
my
surprise
when
i
received
a
bill
for
more
than
what
i
paid
to
have
the
original
return
prepared
.

asked
why
,
rod
simply
told
me
that
he
had
to
research
how
to
do
the
amendment
(
it
was
an
amended
to
show
that
i
had
purchased
a
home
-
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
,
one
would
think
)
and
that
took
time
to
figure
out
.

well
,
that
was
strike
one
.

i
was
n't
going
to
use
them
again
,
but
i
was
going
to
leave
it
at
that
.

however
,
now
that
i
have
come
to
realize
that
i
am
going
to
owe
the
irs
$
6,000
+
despite
doing
exactly
what
rod
told
me
to
do
,
i
feel
i
have
to
voice
my
opinion
.

last
year
,
after
all
was
said
and
done
,
i
asked
rod
whether
my
payment
structure
would
leave
me
with
no
/
little
tax
liability
at
the
end
of
the
year
.

he
said
yes
.

well
,
again
,
i
am
now
faced
with
a
tax
bill
of
$
6,000
+
,
all
due
on
april
15
,
2010
and
all
that
rod
has
to
say
to
the
matter
is
'
well
,
you
wo
n't
have
to
pay
a
penalty
.
'

i
may
not
have
to
pay
a
penalty
,
yet
,
but
this
is
not
what
i
had
in
mind
when
hired
these
guys
.

in
the
words
of
my
new
accountant
,
they
let
me
down
!

bit
sketchy
,
sporadic
delivery
times

i
bought
about
half
of
the
furniture
i
own
from
this
place
.

why
?

because
they
cut
me
good
deals
if
i
paid
in
cash
.

sketchy
,
right
?

well
they
came
through
and
delivered
almost
all
of
my
items
within
a
few
days
.

(
they
even
got
me
a
couch
pretty
quickly
.
)

the
guy
who
was
cutting
me
the
deals
and
getting
me
the
furniture
quickly
,
ahmed
,
was
nice
and
mostly
professional
,
except
the
semi-sketchiness
.

then
one
day
,
ahmed
left
the
country
,
not
to
return
for
months
,
without
informing
me
.

he
also
neglected
to
tell
the
other
person
working
at
the
store
about
a
dining
room
table
that
i
had
ordered
and
that
was
supposed
to
be
coming
in
.

the
other
person
working
at
the
store
did
n't
know
that
i
still
had
this
table
coming
.

i
had
paid
in
cash
,
and
he
said
he
had
no
receipt
/
record
of
my
purchase
.

i
came
back
with
the
receipt
ahmed
had
provided
upon
my
purchase
,
and
the
guy
took
forever
to
copy
it
but
said
that
he
would
take
care
of
the
situation
.

i
waited
.

and
waited
.

he
never
once
contacted
us
.

i
've
had
to
pester
this
new
guy
several
times
to
ask
when
my
table
will
arrive
.

he
kept
saying
different
arrival
/
delivery
dates
and
did
n't
seem
terribly
apologetic
.

it
has
been
3
weeks
and
i
still
do
n't
have
my
table
(
which
was
not
cheap
,
i
might
add
)
.

point
is
:
you
might
be
able
to
get
a
good
deal
on
some
nice
furniture
--
which
i
did
--
but
they
're
not
very
communicative
and
god
forbid
something
goes
wrong
,
you
'll
have
to
fight
to
get
it
resolved
.

poor
service

run
do
n't
walk
.

my
experience
with
home
delivery
service
has
been
one
of
disappointment
and
anger
.

if
i
could
give
them
a
lower
rating
than
poor
i
would
.

on
august
21st
,
2009
i
ordered
furniture
from
hickory
furniture
mart
and
contracted
for
hds
to
deliver
it
.

after
seventeen
days
the
delivery
van
showed
up
at
my
home
minus
two
pieces
.

i
was
later
told
they
had
been
left
at
the
warehouse
and
some
future
date
they
would
be
delivered
.

no
one
will
give
me
a
date
.

i
spent
$
2300
on
the
bedroom
suite
,
which
was
complete
and
excellent
condition
on
the
showroom
floor
.

upon
delivery
it
was
clear
the
entire
set
was
damaged
:
a
piece
of
wood
was
broke
on
the
headboard
;
the
chest
of
drawers
was
missing
all
four
pieces
necessary
to
attach
the
legs
;
the
dresser
back
legs
were
pushed
in
causing
the
dresser
to
lean
into
the
wall
;
and
a
nighstand
was
missing
a
drawer
.

how
do
you
lose
a
drawer
.

after
complaining
on
september
10th
to
national
home
furnishings
,
boyles
,
the
hickory
furniture
mart
and
home
delivery
service
the
latter
finally
called
me
back
and
said
they
would
be
up
to
pick
the
dresser
and
chest
of
drawers
at
some
future
point
and
at
some
later
point
it
would
be
professional
repaired
and
at
some
later
point
it
would
be
returned
.

the
customer
service
at
home
delivery
service
was
terrible
let
alone
their
promise
to
proper
set
up
furniture
.

so
i
am
in
limbo
regarding
a
bedroom
suite
.

i
hope
the
owners
and
employees
of
this
store
have
broken
bedroom
suites
in
their
homes
and
furniture
sitting
in
someone
's
warehouse
.

maybe
then
they
will
begin
to
understand
poor
customer
service
and
terrible
sit
up
service
.

excellent
driving
school

i
was
involved
in
a
car
accident
20
years
ago
and
since
then
i
've
been
a
nervous
wreck
and
have
n't
been
behind
the
wheel
.

unfortunately
,
a
family
emergency
required
me
to
conquer
this
fear
.

a
very
good
friend
of
mine
highly
recommended
the
professional
driving
school
and
i
was
told
to
specifically
ask
for
gerry
.

she
highly
recommended
him
and
described
him
as
the
"
saintly
instructor
and
simply
the
best
instructor
there
is
....
very
calm
,
pleasant
and
very
detailed
in
giving
instructions
"
.

i
called
the
school
most
probably
10
times
before
i
finally
enrolled
in
a
20
hour
package
.

i
had
to
cancel
my
initial
lesson
4
times
and
on
the
5th
attempt
the
management
was
quick
enough
to
associate
my
cancellations
with
my
fear
and
finally
encouraged
me
into
taking
my
initial
lesson
.

five
minutes
before
my
initial
lesson
,
i
got
a
call
from
gerry
advising
me
of
his
arrival
and
to
come
down
as
soon
as
i
was
ready
.

my
heart
pounded
as
i
walked
down
and
pounded
even
faster
upon
seeing
gerry
in
an
suv
-
lexus
!

i
thought
of
canceling
the
lesson
once
again
because
i
did
n't
feel
comfortable
driving
an
suv
.

gerry
pleasantly
said
"
since
i
am
already
here
why
do
n't
we
give
it
shot
.

i
trust
you
and
believe
that
you
'll
be
able
to
handle
this
and
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
reciprocate
!

trust
me
and
most
especially
trust
and
believe
in
yourself
.

do
n't
worry
,
i
'll
take
care
of
you
!
"

.......
the
rest
was
history
!

here
i
am
now
driving
confidently
on
my
own
.

gerry
,
i
ca
n't
thank
you
enough
for
helping
me
cope
with
my
fear
.

to
my
friend
,
thank
you
for
your
recommendation
...
you
were
true
to
your
words
in
saying
gerry
is
a
"
saintly
instructor
...
absolutely
simple
the
best
instructor
and
best
driving
school
there
is
!

review
on
house
of
joy
chinese
restaurant

my
family
and
i
moved
to
san
antonio
a
year
ago
and
have
tried
almost
all
of
the
chinese
restaurants
because
we
love
chinese
food
.

well
it
took
us
a
while
to
find
one
that
we
liked
.

but
we
do
n't
just
like
house
of
joy
we
love
it
.

everything
we
have
gotten
there
has
been
more
authentic
and
better
tasting
than
any
other
chinese
restaurant
in
the
san
antonio
area
we
have
been
to
--
and
trust
me
we
have
been
to
a
lot
of
them
.

we
just
happen
to
stumble
across
this
little
restaurant
one
day
when
we
had
to
visit
the
bexar
county
tax
office
off
of
bandera
road
.

we
stopped
in
and
got
some
take
out
and
can
not
stop
going
back
.

they
have
the
best
egg
drop
soup
i
have
ever
tasted
.

we
also
love
their
egg
rolls
and
spring
rolls
.

and
every
entree
we
have
ordered
is
perfect
.

everything
is
always
cooked
fresh
and
tastes
fresh
.

their
prices
are
extremely
reasonable
for
the
amount
of
food
you
receive
.

the
staff
is
also
just
so
pleasant
to
deal
with
.

they
are
also
quick
at
getting
your
order
out
to
you
.

you
do
n't
have
to
sit
and
wait
around
forever
like
most
places
!!

so
anyone
looking
for
an
excellent
night
out
for
chinese
or
maybe
just
lunch
should
stop
in
and
try
it
because
i
promise
you
2
things
---
you
wo
n't
regret
it
!!

and
you
will
go
back
for
more
!!!

karla
ferguson
-
granger

ps
i
have
noticed
on
here
that
someone
left
a
comment
that
"
all
of
the
nice
comments
must
come
from
co
workers
or
friends
"
and
i
will
tell
you
that
i
do
n't
know
these
people
except
from
eating
at
their
restaurant
.

we
are
from
virginia
and
just
moved
here
a
year
ago
.

so
that
comment
is
completely
false
.

because
we
think
it
's
the
best
!!!

and
we
do
n't
know
them
except
for
eating
there
.

dr.
strzalka
at
flagship
cvts
is
not
a
good
doctor

i
am
not
sure
about
the
quality
of
the
other
doctors
there
,
but
i
do
know
from
personal
experience
that
dr.
christopher
t.
strzalka
is
not
a
man
of
his
word
,
and
is
also
very
cruel
and
uncaring
!!

he
was
going
to
operate
and
replace
my
bicuspid
aortic
valve
due
to
critical
aortic
stenosis
.

i
had
a
surgery
date
of
july
17
,
2008
.

then
he
renigged
when
he
read
my
health
care
proxy
,
even
though
i
agreed
to
be
on
the
ventilator
for
2
months
following
surgery
(
as
he
had
twice
stated
i
must
agree
to
)
.

he
later
said
that
by
2
months
he
"
meant
at
least
two
months
"
.

two
months
and
at
least
two
months
are
totally
different
things
.

he
did
not
even
give
me
the
chance
to
say
i
would
stay
on
the
ventilator
longer
,
which
i
would
have
.

a
health
care
proxy
is
not
written
in
stone
and
can
be
changed
.

he
also
never
even
said
he
was
sorry
.

just
said
i
was
inoperable
and
walked
out
of
the
hospital
room
.

so
,
therefore
,
now
he
says
i
am
inoperable
(
even
though
i
am
not
100
%
inoperable
)
,
and
he
is
letting
me
die
.

i
am
just
middle
aged
and
do
not
want
to
die
,
but
thanks
to
this
doctor
i
have
no
other
alternatives
.

i
,
along
with
my
friends
,
consider
this
doctor
to
be
the
cause
of
my
death
as
he
is
not
even
trying
to
save
my
life
by
operating
.

even
my
pa
i
went
to
the
other
day
said
"
it
must
by
comforting
to
have
gone
to
a
heart
surgeon
like
him
who
will
do
nothing
for
you
"
.

he
said
it
sarcastically
.

if
you
want
a
doctor
who
will
lie
to
you
and
say
he
will
operate
and
then
change
his
mind
,
and
not
know
what
he
is
talking
about
when
he
recommends
procedures
at
other
hospitals
and
says
they
are
what
you
need
,
when
they
will
not
work
for
you
,
go
to
this
doctor
...
he
is
the
one
for
you
.

what
you
can
learn
from
the
below
'
bad
experience
'
.

i
would
suggest
not
avoiding
second
home
based
on
the
'
bad
experience
'
review
.

i
'd
probably
be
more
inclined
to
board
my
two
dogs
here
,
seeing
that
they
do
n't
just
take
every
dog
coming
in
.

i
've
toured
this
place
and
was
impressed
by
how
clean
the
place
was
,
and
all
the
options
for
the
dogs
.

it
's
unfortunate
that
bmil
believed
that
his
'
perfect
'
dog
was
not
given
the
right
opportunity
to
prove
himself
.

but
i
've
done
hundreds
of
dog
introductions
myself
(
another
place
,
i
do
n't
work
here
)
,
and
owners
can
have
unrealistic
expectations
and
views
of
what
they
see
when
their
dogs
meet
other
dogs
.

workers
who
do
these
introductions
look
at
the
interaction
objectively
;
and
it
's
good
to
see
they
are
able
and
willing
to
say
no
if
they
feel
there
would
be
a
problem
.

it
sounds
(
according
to
your
own
statement
)
that
they
had
a
roomful
of
dogs
,
so
they
must
be
doing
something
right
-
and
are
keeping
those
dogs
safe
from
potential
problems
.

you
say
you
work
a
lot
,
and
that
you
have
a
young
dog
;
so
i
have
little
doubt
that
your
dog
is
just
filled
with
energy
to
burn
;
and
it
is
good
of
you
to
look
for
a
place
to
take
him
.

but
not
at
a
risk
to
other
people
's
pets
.

you
were
clearly
given
another
alternative
by
second
home
,
to
board
him
-
which
might
have
given
your
dog
a
chance
to
come
and
go
from
second
home
a
couple
times
,
getting
used
to
the
place
and
maybe
facilitating
another
attempt
to
get
into
daycare
later
.

no
business
is
going
to
push
customers
away
without
good
reason
;
so
is
n't
it
reasonable
to
think
they
might
know
what
they
're
doing
?

my
dogs
are
far
from
perfect
,
and
one
of
them
i
believe
would
be
a
little
much
for
daycare
here
herself
(
at
least
initially
)
.

be
a
little
more
reasonable
with
your
expectations
of
a
place
like
this
;
and
maybe
do
n't
jump
to
personal
attacks
suggesting
that
they
do
n't
want
to
work
hard
,
just
because
you
bruised
your
own
ego
.

dumbest
f'ers
ever

i
called
dominos
tonight
,
it
rang
forever
,
i
get
put
on
hold
twice
without

)

they
say
no

i
laugh
and
say
,
no
,
that

i
said

and
he
says

hotel

he
says
:
i
not
know

i
have

get

i

say

says

say

he
says
:

me

warwick
township

he
gives
the
phone
to
a
girl
,
she
says
,

i
say
,

she
says
,

17th
like

yes

i
say
,
is
14th
street
and
i
am
3
blocks
west
of
broad
and
one
south
of
walnut
.

hmmm
,
she
says
,
then
why
are
you
calling
here
,
we
do
n't
go
past
broad
?

anyway
,
after
much
yelling
and
cussing
i
hung
up
,
grabbed
a
cab
,
and
went
to
geno
's
.

quick
to
take
money
but
not
quick
to
fix
a
problem
!

b&b
came
out
very
quickly
to
give
us
our
quote
back
in
june
.

they
were
very
polite
,
eager
to
answer
any
questions
and
willing
to
wait
for
us
to
return
from
vacation
to
begin
installing
our
fence
.

our
fence
was
installed
quickly
in
august
and
they
had
their
money
and
left
saying
"
workmanship
is
guaranteed
for
a
year
!
"
.

within
a
week
we
noticed
one
of
the
boards
on
our
gate
splitting
where
a
nail
had
gone
in
.

we
called
our
representative
who
assured
me
he
would
call
the
office
and
have
it
taken
care
of
.

we
heard
nothing
.

we
then
called
the
office
and
the
man
we
spoke
to
said
he
'd
send
someone
out
to
look
at
it
but
could
n't
promise
when
-
two
weeks
came
and
went
and
we
heard
nothing
.

i
just
called
again
and
was
told
that
workmanship
,
not
wood
,
is
guaranteed
for
a
year
-
well
in
my
opinion
-
the
wood
split
due
to
a
nail
which
is
part
of
workmanship
!

she
even
went
so
far
as
to
say
"
you
r
calling
about
one
board
?
"

well
-
when
you
pay
over
$
1000
for
something
you
want
it
to
hold
up
and
look
good
!!!

yes
!

i
was
calling
about
one
board
!!

i
'm
very
frustrated
at
this
point
-
it
would
take
all
of
10
min
for
them
to
come
by
and
replace
the
one
board
that
is
cracked
(
the
crack
is
deep
enough
to
stick
a
penny
in
it
and
it
goes
clear
through
)
yet
they
do
not
want
to
take
the
time
to
bother
with
what
once
was
a
happy
customer
and
has
now
become
a
dissatisfied
customer
.

so
i
figure
if
they
do
n't
want
to
take
the
time
to
fix
the
fence
that
they
installed
then
i
'll
take
the
time
to
let
everyone
i
can
know
about
how
they
treat
customers
once
they
have
your
money
!!!

stay
away
!!!

you
get
what
you
pay
for
!!!

they
came
in
under
a
lot
of
other
quotes
and
now
i
know
why
!!!

when
the
fence
was
first
installed
i
would
have
given
them
five
stars
,
now
for
their
poor
customer
follow
-
up
and
unwillingness
to
fix
the
fence
they
have
dropped
to
a
one
-
star
in
my
opinion
!

lots
of
rules
,
phantom
innkeeper
,
last
minute
price
was
worth
it
.

i
called
the
"
207
"
number
and
listened
to
the
same
recording
loop
3
times
before
i
gave
up
.

i
then
called
the
800
number
(
which
was
answered
)
and
inquired
about
last
minute
rates
.

they
had
a
room
with
a
$
99
rate
,
which
i
booked
.

the
room
was
supposed
to
be
on
the
2nd
floor
,
but
they
put
us
on
the
3rd
.

the
email
confirmation
(
which
i
read
in
the
car
)
warned
about
large
suitcases
,
declaring
that
we
are
innkeepers
,
not
longshoreman
.

in
other
words
,
they
do
not
help
with
suitcases
,
but
they
promise
totes
to
help
.

however
upon
our
arrival
no
one
there
(
the
inn
was
open
)
.

so
no
totes
.

finally
a
chambermaid
stuck
her
head
around
the
corner
from
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
told
us
sternly
that
we
could
not
be
accommodated
until
3
m
,
no
exceptions
.

then
she
was
gone
.

we
returned
after
3
pm
,
found
no
one
there
,
and
a
note
from
the
innkeeper
with
directions
to
our
room
.

never

these

snacks
:
uninspired

and
individual
coffee

i
'd
go

i
could
get
the
last
minute
rate
again
of
$
99
,
but
i
would
n't
pay
their
rack
rate
.

quit
with
the
overstatements
!

the
worst
thing
that
can
happen
for
any
restaurant
like
zahav
is
to
have
too
many
people
write
hyperbolic
reviews
making
claims
that
"
everyone
"
is
going
to
"
love
"
the
food
,
decor
and
service
.

the
truth
is
,
in
my
and
my
dining
partners
'
experience
,
this
is
a
fine
little
restaurant
with
some
unique
food
.

it
's
an
entirely
up
and
down
experience
,
however
.

now
,
the
best
of
that
unique
food
comes
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
meal
.

the
salatim
salads
are
the
smallest
plates
i
've
ever
seen
placed
in
front
of
me
(
you
would
most
likely
think
they
were
condiments
if
it
were
n't
explained
to
you
)
.

though
they
are
mostly
excellent
,
you
generally
do
n't
get
enough
forkfuls
to
know
if
you
really
love
them
.

that
being
said
,
the
laffa
and
hummus
are
out
of
this
world
.

then
again
,
for
the
three
of
us
who
dined
together
,
two
pieces
of
flatbread
left
us
fighting
for
more
,
and
licking
the
hummus
from
our
fingers
(
and
yes
,
those
two
pieces
of
flatbread
did
represent
a
three
-
person
order
)
.

dinner
was
also
an
up
-
and
-
down
experience
.

the
vegetarian
dishes
and
lighter
fare
were
almost
always
spot
-
on
,
while
the
lamb
was
often
dry
and
/
or
overcooked
.

the
duck
was
a
65
%
glob
of
chewy
fat
with
no
resemblance
to
the
juicy
,
crispy
delicacy
it
usually
represents
at
other
establishments
.

dessert
was
...
hmmm
,
that
's
interesting
,
i
do
n't
even
remember
dessert
.

i
guess
that
tells
you
a
lot
.

oh
,
yes
,
the
chocolate
semifreddo
was
quite
good
.

the
warm
chocolate
cake
was
very
tasty
,
but
served
at
room
temperature
,
not
warm
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
.

and
my
--
no
,
i
still
do
n't
remember
what
i
had
.

service
was
average
,
but
nothing
special
,
and
restaurants
that
are
supposed
to
be
excellent
should
do
a
better
job
of
training
their
waitstaff
to
be
communicative
and
friendly
,
not
merely
capable
.

perhaps
had
we
not
gone
into
this
restaurant
believing
zahav
was
going
to
be
golden
as
its
name
suggests
(
and
as
the
many
golden
reviews
seem
to
attest
)
,
we
would
have
enjoyed
a
decent
little
expensive
experience
.

but
one
should
not
go
here
expecting
something
fantastic
,
unless
perhaps
you
've
never
had
middle
-
eastern
food
before
,
or
succulent
duck
,
tasty
lamb
,
decent
portion
sizes
or
actually
warm
chocolate
desserts
.

ps
)
when
we
called
for
a
reservation
,
we
were
told
that
5:00
and
9:30
were
their
only
openings
.

when
we
arrived
at
5
,
and
left
circa
7
,
there
were
the
same
4
or
5
empty
tables
surrounding
us
.

did
they
think
we
were
going
to
feel
lucky
to
get
any
reservation
at
all
,
and
therefore
be
more
pleased
with
our
dining
experience
?

must
read
-
do
not
waste
your
time
in
this
store
.

at
my
appointment
the
girl
helping
me
was
unable
to
adequately
lace
up
some
of
the
dresses
.

they
felt
like
they
were
going
to
fall
off
of
me
and
it
was
very
difficult
to
see
what
i
would
actually
look
like
were
i
to
purchase
some
of
these
dresses
.

i
thought
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
see
how
a
few
that
i
liked
would
look
like
on
a
model
(
by
looking
the
dress
up
online
)
.

so
,
as
i
was
leaving
i
asked
for
the
designer
/
dress
name
or
style
number
associated
with
my
top
picks
.

they
said
they
were
"
unable
to
tell
me
until
they
ordered
my
dress
"
.

hmmm
...
a
person
can
not
call
a
company
,
if
you
have
no
idea
its
name
(
since
the
designer
is
unknown
...
supposedly
)
,
and
order
a
gown
without
a
dress
name
or
style
number
.

do
other
brides
fall
for
this
???

they
either
:
a
)
do
n't
want
to
give
it
to
me
because
they
do
n't
want
me
purchasing
the
dress
elsewhere
or
b
)
are
recreating
the
dresses
themselves
(
ie
stealing
other
designers
'
dress
designs
and
"
filling
the
orders
"
by
their
own
seamstresses
)
.

i
'm
no
detective
but
...
uhh
...
seriously
?!?

whatever
type
of
operation
they
are
running
,
i
'm
not
interested
and
if
you
're
smart
,
you
wo
n't
be
either
.

what
a
waste
of
time
.

aside
from
that
little
*
mystery
*
,
one
of
the
sales
ladies
was
quite
comfortable
telling
me
how
wrong
i
was
about
how
another
dress
that
i
loved
compared
to
one
of
her
dresses
that
i
was
trying
on
.

somehow
,
since
she
supposedly
does
n't
know
any
names
of
designers
/
dresses
,
after
i
told
her
the
designer
and
dress
name
of
the
one
i
was
comparing
,
she
knew
"
exactly
which
dress
"
i
was
referring
to
and
disagreed
with
my
observation
;
she
said
that
the
bodice
did
come
as
low
as
the
one
i
had
on
.

my
point
:
even
if
i
was
wrong
,
do
n't
sit
there
and
argue
with
the
customer
.

say
something
like
,
"
huh
.

i
did
n't
think
so
but
you
could
be
right
.
"

unless
you
want
to
take
the
"
tell
the
customer
how
wrong
she
is
and
try
and
force
her
into
a
dress
she
's
obviously
not
loving
"
approach
which
will
likely
get
you
...
uh
...
nowhere
.

seriously
:
do
not
waste
your
time
.

other
shops
around
this
city
have
much
nicer
and
more
transparent
owners
.

not
owners
that
seem
like
they
have
something
to
hide
and
know
nothing
about
common
courtesy
and
customer
service
.

i
felt
very
much
like
wedding
gallery
was
being
dishonest
and
i
would
n't
trust
them
to
lace
me
up
in
another
gown
let
alone
trust
them
with
the
gown
i
will
wear
on
the
most
important
day
of
my
life
.

awful
service
!

after
happily
visiting
sear's
automotives
in
the
past
,
i
was
shocked
at
the
horrible
service
received
at
their
greensboro
location
.

i
brought
my
car
in
on
a
sunday
to
replace
a
shredded
tire
.

i
waited
about
20
minutes
in
the
store
part
before
anyone
was
able
to
assist
me
and
was
then
told
to
pull
my
car
into
the
shop
(
that
is
apparently
what
you
are
supposed
to
do
,
but
the
big
signs
pointing
you
that
way
are
for
some
reason
kept
inside
the
garage
,
so
you
do
n't
see
them
drving
up
,
and
they
purposely
block
the
front
pull
-
up
that
all
other
sear's
use
)
.

once
inside
,
i
had
to
stand
around
for
at
least
10
more
minutes
before
--
finally
--
a
technician
got
to
me
.

once
i
returned
to
pick
up
my
car
,
you
can
believe
i
spent
quite
a
bit
more
time
standing
around
waiting
.

i
had
wanted
to
split
the
total
between
a
credit
card
and
check
card
since
i
was
being
reimbursed
for
the
tire
but
was
told
this
was
n't
possible
.

once
i
actually
got
back
in
my
car
,
it
was
dirty
and
had
grease
all
over
the
steering
wheel
.

ok
,
one
bad
experience
...
fine
.

the
following
friday
,
i
returned
with
my
car
to
go
ahead
and
replace
the
other
3
tires
,
which
were
worn
.

i
would
not
have
gone
back
,
but
i
could
n't
find
the
particular
tire
they
'd
used
in
stock
anywhere
else
.

once
again
,
i
waited
for
quite
a
bit
before
being
attended
to
.

i
got
the
order
completed
,
and
then
questioned
the
technician
since
it
came
out
about
$
40
less
than
i
expected
.

he
said
it
was
the
same
tire
,
and
verified
this
,
after
checking
both
the
actual
tire
on
my
car
and
my
service
papers
from
earlier
in
the
week
.

however
,
when
he
printed
out
the
service
quote
,
i
could
see
that
it
was
not
the
correct
tire
,
and
was
not
even
an
appropriate
tire
for
my
car
model
.

so
i
pointed
this
out
to
him
,
at
which
point
he
said
they
only
had
one
of
the
correct
tires
in
stock
.

ok
--
fine
.

so
i
got
just
my
other
rear
tire
replaced
.

they
promised
it
'd
be
done
within
an
hour
,
so
i
waited
in
the
lobby
.

over
two
hours
later
(
and
ten
minutes
before
they
closed
)
my
car
was
finally
finished
.

a
few
minutes
after
i
left
,
i
was
called
and
informed
that
"
i
"
left
my
wheel
lock
(
which
they
should
have
left
in
the
car
)
.

of
course
,
they
would
be
closing
in
5
minutes
,
so
i
would
have
to
hurry
up
or
get
it
the
next
day
.

of
course
i
could
n't
make
it
back
in
time
(
and
they
apparently
could
not
stay
5
extra
minutes
to
wait
for
me
)
.

the
next
day
,
no
one
could
find
my
wheel
lock
and
that
particular
technician
was
not
in
.

of
course
,
they
could
n't
call
him
either
to
ask
about
it
because
apparently
they
do
n't
keep
their
employees
'
phone
numbers
(
riiight
)
,
so
i
would
have
to
return
on
monday
(
driving
for
3
days
now
with
no
wheel
lock
should
i
get
a
flat
)
.

on
monday
i
called
and
again
it
was
a
big
to
-
do
to
find
anyone
who
knew
anything
about
it
.

supposedly
they
will
be
holding
it
for
me
this
evening
,
but
i
'm
sure
that
will
also
be
a
huge
ordeal
.

the
employees
at
this
sear's
are
completely
apathetic
and
there
did
n't
seem
to
be
any
sort
of
management
that
i
could
see
.

i
will
never
return
there
again
(
and
now
have
some
serious
doubts
about
the
quality
of
work
they
actually
performed
on
my
car
)
.
the
dude
who
grills
the
retarded
dogs
is
rude
.

if
this
is
the
best
that
tucson
has
to
offer
,
i
am
out
ta
here
...

i
called
on
a
friday
at
12:30
complaining
of
a
severe
toothache
.

dr.
obina
told
me
that
his
office
closed
at
noon
and
that
i
should
call
him
on
monday
.

i
had
been
a
patient
of
dr.
olbina
for
9
years
and
had
spent
thousands
of
dollars
on
crowns
etc
.

there
are
plenty
of
good
dentists
in
fernandina
.

do
n't
go
to
amelia
gentle
dentistry
.

good
location

for
a
hotel
like
this
you
would
expect
some
form
of
free
internet
.

what
you
get
is
a
$
13
/
day
charge
to
access
the
internet
through
a
slow
512
/
512
kb
/
s
that
you
can
only
use
to
check
email
etc
(
read
:
no
downloading
)
.

other
than
that
the
hotel
is
in
a
good
location
and
the
breakfast
is
great

make
you
feel
like
a
number

stay
away
from
kids
first
west
chester
.

you
never
get
a
human
on
the
phone
.

it
's
impossible
to
get
an
appointment
.

if
you
get
caught
in
traffic
and
are
a
couple
minutes
late
they
make
you
re-schedule
...
for
6
weeks
later
.

and
worst
of
all
your
child
feels
like
a
number
not
a
patient
.

go
somewhere
else
.

first
time
eating
at
caffe
bella
italia
and
it
was
a
wonderful
experience
.

from
the
delectable
antipasto
misto
to
the
spaghetti
alla
barese
and
the
parmigiana
and
ending
with
gelato
,
all
was
mouth
watering
.

too
bad
they
were
out
of
the
chocolate
lava
cake
.

maybe
next
time
they
will
have
it
.

service
was
excellent
!

sandy

beware
of
sharayu

hopless
service
,
at
the
time
of
booking
my
car
a
lot
was
promised
but
delivered
not
even
one
tenth
of
what
was
promised
.

apart
from
that
in
spite
of
my
repeated
attempts
i
could
not
get
in
touch
with
the
manager
to
even
lodge
an
official
complaint
.

my
advise
to
all
is
i
have
fallen
into
this
trap
...
pl
ensure
you
do
nt
!!!

course
has
come
a
long
way
!!

hcc
's
new
nine
was
a
little
shaky
at
first
,
but
the
new
grounds
superintendant
has
done
wonders
for
the
course
!!

the
comment
below
definitely
needs
to
be
retracted
!

come
back
and
give
hcc
a
second
chance
at
least
!

it
is
a
great
course
for
local
golfers
to
be
proud
of
and
all
the
comments
in
2008
have
been
very
positive
!!

excellent
physiotherapists
!

kusal
goonewardena
and
his
team
of
physios
are
unbelievable
!

i
have
been
suffering
from
back
pain
for
over
12
years
and
have
been
to
numerous
specialists
,
physios
,
osteos
and
chiros
with
no
help
.

it
took
the
vigor
team
only
4
visits
to
get
me
feeling
normal
!

and
now
2
months
after
my
last
appointment
i
am
better
than
ever
.

thanks
guys
!

they
must
have
read
these
reviews
and
improved
!

my
husband
and
i
happened
in
on
a
whim
.

we
sat
in
the
front
dining
area
,
it
was
very
cozy
and
pleasant
.

our
server
was
quite
attentive
and
the
food
was
fantastic
.

my
husband
has
been
a
professional
chef
,
so
he
is
a
good
judge
of
quality
food
.

this
was
a
flavorful
,
enjoyable
meal
for
both
of
us
.

rude
rude
rude

went
in
there
and
got
my
dog
groomed
came
home
to
an
uneven
dog
then
took
him
back
to
get
evened
up
what
a
mistake
!

she
did
nt
even
let
me
finish
a
sentence
without
insulting
me
and
telling
me
how
i
should
have
said
it
!

i
wo
nt
go
back
!

she
needs
to
develop
a
personality
!

brought
dog
home
and
it
s
all
choppy
now
!

it
's
helpful
to
know
a
quite
a
bit
about
bull
fighting
.

if
you
watch
a
lot
of
fights
(
youtube
)
and
research
some
of
the
history
(
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bullfighting
)
you
will
find
yourself
enjoying
it
a
lot
more
!

also
after
seeing
a
handful
of
bullfights
,
i
can
say
that
they
're
a
lot
more
enjoyable
if
you
're
smashed
(
bac
>=
.15
)
.

all
i
can
say
is
that
i
am
glad
i
went
in
!

the
nurses
are
sweet
as
pie
and
the
doctor
is
wonderful
.

this
place
is
about
healing
,
not
making
a
buck
.

the
followup
visit
is
free
!!

after
going
to
the
hospital
and
paying
er
prices
...
there
is
no
way
i
wo
n't
be
back
here
!!

i
will
be
back
and
telling
everyone
about
this
clinic
.

thank
you
!!

i
just
like
the
fact
that
he
was
able
to
do
the
specific
type
of
repair
i
wanted
(
a
reball
)
and
give
me
the
longest
warranty
and
even
a
lower
price
.

someone
else
i
found
that
said
they
could
do
it
but
wanted
to
charge
me
more
and
give
me
less
warranty
.

it
was
a
no
brainer
really
.

i
choose
console
pros
and
i
'm
happy
i
did
.

this
place
is
bad
.

it
's
dark
,
dingy
&
dirty
.

the
salads
are
limp
and
the
rest
of
the
food
is
n't
any
better
(
ok
,
the
nachos
are
not
too
bad
!
)

this
place
may
have
been
something
sometime
;
but
it
way
past
it
"
sell
by
date
"
.

i
have
eaten
here
twice
in
the
past
year
and
will
not
go
back
and
can
not
recommend
it
.

rip

this
is
the
original
ham
's
restaurant
,
expanded
into
a
regional
chain
in
the
late
80's
--
but
this
one
is
no
more
.

victim
of
hard
times
and
i
suspect
failing
corporate
management
.

according
to
news
accounts
,
the
company
is
struggling
.

i
have
many
fond
memories
of
my
college
evenings
there
long
ago
.

so
long
ham
s
...
you
will
be
missed
.

we
are
very
pleased
with
the
services
of
first
glass
window
.

our
window
panes
were
so
dirty
that
they
needed
a
specialist
to
come
and
clean
them
.

we
called
few
companies
before
we
decide
to
hire
them
.

they
came
on
time
and
completed
their
work
quickly
.

we
were
very
happy
how
clean
looked
our
windows
.

if
you
have
some
problems
with
your
windows
,
you
should
call
them
.

great
help
even
near
closing
time
!

i
came
in

for
a

came
in
30
min
before
close
and
the
staff
was
super
helpful
.

they
spent
a
lot
of
time
with
me
and
got
me
into
a
great
pair
of
shoes
.

i
think
they
may
even
be
better
than
the
pair
i
have
been
using
this
past
year
!

thanks
run
on
!

great

this
is
a
perfect
place
to
get
your
hair
done
.

i
have
gone
there
time
and
time
again
whenever
i
need
to
get
my
hair
done
or
when
i
want
a
haircut
.

when
i
get
my
hair
done
there
,
they
use
enough
hairstyling
products
while
it
does
not
ruin
your
hair
.

the
service
is
great
and
during
weekends
it
tends
to
get
busy
,
but
the
wait
is
worthwhile
.

highly
recommend

i
have
worked
with
shannon
as
my
massage
therapist
and
intuitive
bodyworker
for
years
and
have
never
been
disappointed
.

no
matter
what
state
i
am
in
when
i
arrive
,
i
always
leave
feeling
better
.

she
has
not
only
helped
me
through
some
challenging
computer
-
work
and
sports
related
injuries
,
she
was
wonderful
to
work
with
throughout
my
pregnancy
and
beyond
.

i
highly
recommend
her
.

best
store
in
boothbay
harbor

what
a
fantastic
store
,
i
love
this
place
.

not
the
same
old
stuff
that
all
the
other
stores
have
.

their
items
are
very
unique
,
great
quality
,
great
prices
.

they
also
have
the
best
tea
i
ever
had
,
not
at
all
like
the
junk
you
get
at
the
grocery
stores
,
i
stock
up
when
ever
there
because
they
are
closed
in
the
winter
.

the
best

dr.
aster
and
her
team
have
been
a
strong
advocate
in
the
health
of
both
my
daughters
.

dr.
aster
is
very
kind
an
gentle
with
the
children
,
but
also
positive
and
to
the
point
with
the
parents
.

she
is
and
excellent
doctor
to
have
on
one
's
team
.

even
though
i
live
pretty
far
from
her
office
i
still
make
the
trip
so
my
daughters
will
have
the
best
!

my
wife
and
i
avoided
doing
some
fairly
simple
electrical
re-wiring
in
our
home
for
several
years
due
to
overall
hassle
and
cost
involved
.

i
finally
called
matt
from
bonafide
and
he
made
the
project
both
easy
for
us
and
reasonable
.

he
was
prompt
,
knowledgable
,
friendly
,
clean
and
just
an
overall
great
guy
who
obviously
cares
about
his
business
.

i
will
reccommend
his
services
however
/
whenever
possible
!

real
pros

i
've
had
writer
friends
describe
horror
stories
with
their
printers
.

i
tell
them
:
why
not
just
go
with
these
guys
?

richard
joule
and
the
gang
are
pros
from
start
to
finish
.

they
set
out
to
exceed
your
expectations
.

already
i
'm
considering
future
projects
,
and
i
can
assure
you
that
for
my
printing
needs
i
will
be
choosing
no
other
than
atlanta
paperback
book
printing
.

i
have
been
here
3
times
and
all
3
times
it
has
been
bad
!

they
have
messed
up
my
order
and
....
the
food
was
just
not
good
!

i
had
sonic
in
many
other
palces
but
for
some
reason
this
sonic
is
always
just
covered
in
grease
and
not
good
...
:(

i
hope
they
get
there
act
together
...

i
am
going
to
give
it
one
last
chance
in
next
few
months
and
see
??

i
called
them
for
an
estimate
and
they
insulted
me
when
i
ask
them
questions
.

they
are
very
rude
and
nasty
.

please
do
n't
use
this
moving
company
if
you
do
n't
want
to
:
cry
,
have
trouble
and
a
bad
experience
on
the
day
of
your
move
.

they
will
give
you
a
low
price
over
the
phone
and
on
the
day
of
your
move
they
will
change
the
price
,
i
guarantee
it
.

you
've
got
maids
did
a
fabulous
job
cleaning
my
home
.

i
am
hiring
them
to
come
once
a
week
now
that
they
got
my
house
to
where
they
can
maintain
it
for
only
an
hour
and
a
half
every
two
weeks
!

satisfactory
for
sure
with
the
sercvice
!

beats
having
one
"
cleaning
lady
"
who
took
twice
as
long
and
did
not
do
a
very
through
job
like
the
"
maids
"
did
!

this
place
has
the
best
baby
and
children
s
clothes
.

especially
high
end
keep
sake
sort
of
clothing
that
you
just
ca
nt
find
in
a
lot
of
stores
.

it
is
all
very
unique
and
you
wo
nt
find
any
other
baby
wearing
the
same
stuff
.

i
spent
quite
a
bit
because
i
spoil
my
little
princess
.

after
all
she
will
only
be
a
baby
for
so
long
i
figure
why
not
enjoy
it
.

antique
lighting
,
fixtures
,
chicago

great
place
for
antique
lighting
!

i
visited
their
huge
chicago
lighting
showroom
and
all
i
have
to
say
is
wow
!!

lots
of
collections
,
many
antique
light
fixtures
,
chandeliers
,
custom
lighting
etc
.

i
think
they
have
the
largest
collection
for
chandeliers
chicago
.

antiques
,
vintage
,
contemporary
&
modern
chandeliers
.

i
would
recommend
them
for
any
custom
lighting
or

repair
and
restoration
chicago

great
food
awesome
food
awesome
service

i
wanted
to
try
someplace
new
again
.

this
place
rocked
.

brought
my
wife
deb
with
me
and
she
like
the
fried
crab
wontons
and
said
they
were
good
..

we
also
had
the
bbq
spare
ribs
..
good
also
.

i
ordered
the
moo
shu
pork
and
it
was
great
..

i
also
ordered
the
neptune
platter
which
was
awesome
...
so
this
place
gets
5
out
of
5
stars
.

do
not
go
here
!!!

i
went
to
get
my
nails
filled
friday
,
by
monday
2
were
broken
.

i
was
not
happy
with
the
way
they
looked
,
very
wavy
,
uneven
edges
,
and
with
the
exception
of
1
,
there
is
a
dip
in
the
center
of
each
nail
.

i
also
had
a
pedicure
,
and
they
cut
my
nails
too
short
,
one
of
my
big
toes
looks
like
it
s
getting
infected
.

no
way
.

i
'm
certainly
no
expert
on
asian
food
in
fact
not
even
a
lover
of
vietnamese
food
but
i
wanted
to
try
the
real
things
here
at
a
dong
.

cold
,
slimy
,
tasteless
however
is
the
same
in
all
languages
and
foods
.

not
good
,
not
great
,
and
again
another
disappointment
in
central
iowa
.

how
do
these
places
stay
in
business
.

this
town
needs
some
food
soul
and
this
is
not
it
.

worth
every
penny

my
girlfriend
and
i
ate
at
the
grill
last
night
,
and
our
experience
was
amazing
.

everything
we
ordered
was
prepared
to
perfection
,
and
was
presented
perfectly
.

the
asparagus
,
seared
tuna
,
and
lobster
tail
were
the
best
we
ever
had
.

then
the
desserts
came
,
and
they
were
hands
down
the
best
dessert
we
ever
had
.

i
will
sum
it
up
with
,
it
was
worth
every
penny
!

best
chinese
restaurant
ever
!!!

it
was
the
best
chinese
food
i
have
ever
had
.

all
the
food
tasted
excellent
,
and
with
the
new
renovation
of
chairs
and
the
bathroom
,
it
is
awesome
.

the
people
working
their
are
also
extremely
polite
and
friendly
.

every
time
i
go
,
kevin
,
the
manager
,
will
always
remember
my
family
and
i
.

overall
,
it
is
very
family
oriented
,
and
i
recommend
it
to
everyone
!!!

professional
and
inspiring

nigel
from
nidd
design
has
always
provided
a
first
class
service
,
from
his
advice
and
professionalism
to
the
quality
of
his
design

planning
applications

his

help
smooth

he

we
came
at

730
and
they
close
at
8
and
wanted
to
try
the
specials
but
they
were
out
for
the
day
so
i
would
say
go
way
before
they
close
.

got
the
crab
rangoon
which
was
great
,
tofu
with
cabbage
which
was
spicy
but
good
and
shrimp
satay
which
was
also
good
.

def
going
to
come
back
and
try
this
place
again
.

bea
was
really
nice
and
asked
how
the
food
was
.

cute
place
also

as
a
native
southern
californian
i
can
tell
you
that
this
is
not
authentic
mexican
food
.

however
,
i
still
like
this
place
a
lot
.

esp.
the
mole
,
tortilla
soup
,
and
guacamole
.

margaritas
are
alright
.

my
only
complaint
is
the
queso
.

it
used
to
be
fabulous
,
why
did
you
guys
change
it
??

queso
should
not
be
watery
:(
.....

***
update
***
never
mind
!

they
fixed
the
queso
!

at

.

in
fact
my
friend
vomited
after
our

maybe
we
ordered
the
wrong
dish
but
my
experience
here
was
poor
.

service
was
okay
not
great
,
we
came
for

small
firm
with
great
service

bloom
legal
was
really
attentive
to
my
problem
,
and
seth
bloom
took
the
time
to
help
me
understand
the
legal
issue
i
was
dealing
with
.

i
much
preferred
the
one
-
on
-
one
service
here
to
the
experiences
i
've
had
with
bigger
offices
and
firms
.

while
i
hope
i
do
n't
have
any
need
for
a
lawyer
anytime
soon
,
if
i
do
i
'll
definitely
use
this
firm
again
.

used
their
service
for
the
first
time
and
was
immediately
impressed
by
their
professionalism
(
received
a
phone
call
soon
after
order
was
placed
to
confirm
details
)
and
the
subsequent
delivery
of
my
gift
(
to
split
,
croatia
)
was
as
requested
.

the
gift
itself
was
exactly
as
described
and
pictured
in
the
catalogue
and
of
the
highest
standard
.

would
highly
recommend
to
anyone
requiring
overseas

love
my
gym
!

fitness

is
a
second
home
to
a
lot
of
us
gym
members
who
work
out
daily
.

if

are
serious
about
working
out
in
a
non-commercial
like
atmosphere
then
you
have
chosen
the
best
place
to
be
.

this
is
the
most
humble
gym
you
will
every
step
into

if
you
dare
to
work

your
body
do
n't
be
surprised
when
you
see
how
addicting
going
to
fitness

can
be
!!

over-rated
...

this
restaurant
is
over-rated
.

it
is
hard
to
find
...
and
the
mexican
food
is
bland
,
almost
equivalent
to
eating
out
of
a
can
.

the
service
is
poor
...

i
asked
for
a
fried
egg
on
my
enchiladas
...
and
did
not
get
it
.!

secondly
,
the
enchladas
did
not
come
with
enchilada
sauce
..
but
chili
...
like
hormel
's
chili
..
the
cheese
was
american
cheese
!

the
chili
relleno
..
had
no
batter
on
it
.

i
googled
restaurants
in
the
area
and
fuji
sushi
came
up
and
reviews
were
great
so
i
made
a
carry
out
order
of
:
l
17
.

mixed
tempura
.....................
8.25
shrimp
or
vegetable
tempura
&
salad
.

i
was
very
happy
with
the
customer
service
and
even
more
please
with
the
portion
size
,
to
go
box
set
up
and
quality
of
the
food
for
the
price
.

i
'm
very
happy
and
will
definitely
dine
in
and
carry
out
again
.

good
pizza
at
a
good
price

i
just
moved
nearby
and
have
tried
several
of
the
local
places
,
this
was
the
first
one
and
i
should
have
just
stuck
with
it
.

the
pizza
is
usually
pretty
good
,
the
only
bad
one
we
got
was
on
a
friday
night
and
it
just
needed
to
be
cooked
a
little
more
,
but
it
was
still
good
.

their
bbq
chicken
pizza
is
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
ever
had
.

horrible
service
!!!

absolute
horrible
service
from
the
parts
department
.

they
are
very
rude
over
the
phone
and
in
person
.

they
talk
down
to
you
like
they
are
supreme
beings
,
if
you
hate
your
job
so
much
then
quit
!!

how
these
guys
can
get
away
with
being
so
rude
with
people
is
mind
blowing
.

i
will
never
do
business
with
sun
toyota
again
.

thank
god
there
are
plenty
of
toyota
dealerships
to
choose
from
in
this
city
.

this
is
a
good
place

i
have
been
here
before
and
the
service
was
absoulutely
great
.

they
had
a
great
selection
of
colors
to
choose
from
and
their
seats
are
super
comfty
.

i
enjoy
going
there
although
i
've
only
been
there
once
,
i
will
be
returning
toda
to
recieve
a
pair
of
french
tips
and
i
will
only
go
to
the
best
and
to
me
the
best
is
here
.

i
reccomend
you
to
go
and
enjoy
their
wonderful
hospitality
.

anna
marie
and
govind
are
very
sweet
people
,
and
the
minute
you
steep
into
their
school
,
the
calm
loving
atmosphere
takes
over
,
and
tension
and
worries
stay
outside
in
the
street
,
whether
or
not
you
pick
them
up
again
after
class
is
probably
a
question
of
practice
.

a
wonderful
place
,
if
you
want
more
than
just
the
physical
side
of
yoga
.

give
yourself
the
gift
of
trying
this
place
,
to
see
if
it
fits
you
...

they
do
n't
seem
to
be
interested
in
selling
cars
.

went
there
yesterday
:
we
are
trying
to
decide
between
two
different
honda
models
,
so
we
wanted
to
test
-
drive
both
back
to
back
.

the
salesperson
refused
!

claimed
he
was
too
busy
for
two
test
drives
.

we
were
the
only
customers
there
!

do
n't
waste
time
,
just
drive
10
minutes
more
down
to
stevens
creek
,
they
actually
do
try
to
help
their
customers
there
!

ate
here
a
couple
times
.

it
is
not
a
high
end
steak
house
,
more
of
the
cuisine
brett
enjoys
in
mississippi
.

so
,
if
you
want
a
burger
and
fries
,
well
,
it
is
ok
.

if
you
want
a
little
cajunish
food
-
it
is
good
.

if
you
want
a
steak
,
well
,
this
is
not
the
best
in
green
bay
.

overall
decent
but
if
you
are
expecting
a
ruth
chris
type
steak
,
this
is
not
it
.

eulogic

good
place
to
be
on
a
sunday
night
.

the
beers
were
good
,
nice
choice
of
beers
as
well
,
and
as
usual
the
mussels
were
great
,
the
place
upstairs
is
a
nice
addition
to
the
bar
downstairs
.

filled
up
on
too
much
beer
and
hence
can
not
comment
on
the
food
.

but
the
menu
had
standard
stuff
that
one
would
get
at
a
belgian
tavern
.

if
you
are
a
handcraft
beer
person
,
this
is
a
fantastic
place
to
be
.

perfect
location
plus

i
moved
into
the
tanglewood
apartments
in
late
2008
and
it
's
been
a
refreshing
change
.

i
used
to
live
at
meadowrun
and
that
was
a
nightmare
.

the
manager
-
tiffany
-
is
actually
very
nice
so
i
'm
a
bit
surprised
by
other
comments
.

she
's
very
reachable
and
she
has
always
responded
quickly
to
any
questions
or
requests
.

plus
she
plans
a
monthly
breakfasts
and
other
events
at
the
clubhouse
which
is
a
nice
added
benefit
.

great
service
/
deals
-
support
this
local
business

i
have
used
these
guys
for
new
snows
,
fixing
lots
of
flats
,
used
replacement
tires
,
and
oil
changes
.

they
have
the
best
prices
locally
and
good
customer
service
.

one
guy
is
a
little
surley
,
but
who
gives
a
crap
as
long
as
your
car
's
work
is
outstanding
.

and
they
're
usually
able
to
help
you
as
a
walk
-
in
,
and
they
're
fast
.

overall
-
good
stuff
.

another
great
business
bites
the
dust
!

the
best
cakes
ever
!

a
bit
pricey
,
so
i
did
n't
go
very
often
,
but
it
was
always
a
treat
when
i
did
.

the
prices
were
worth
what
i
got
.

i
'm
assuming
they
are
completely
out
of
business
since
i
ca
n't
find
any
contact
information
.

i
'm
hoping
the
bakers
continue
to
do
their
baking
out
of
another
place
,
because
it
would
be
a
shame
not
to
have
these
cakes
any
longer
.

super
nice
people
,
really
good
food

what
i
love
most
about
this
place
,
other
than
the
food
,
is
that
eating
here
makes
you
feel
like
you
're
in
a
small
town
rather
than
baltimore
.

the
owners
are
really
nice
,
they
serve
good
food
at
a
good
price
,
and
the
option
to
eat
outside
on
the
deck
(
esp
on
the
weekend
whether
there
is
hardly
any
traffic
)
is
great
.

one
of
my
top
5
places
to
eat
in
baltimore
.

overpriced

this
place
is
identical
to
the
youngstown
sports
grille
,
so
i
imagine
they
are
owned
/
operated
by
the
same
people
.

the
food
is
mediocre
at
best
,
and
largely
overpriced
given
the
portion
size
and
quality
.

do
n't
even
get
me
started
on
how
expensive
it
is
to
drink
there
.

i
have
ate
here
3
times
since
they
first
opened
,
and
the
service
has
been
poor
each
time
,
the
staff
always
comes
across
as
somewhat
rude
and
slow
.

enjoyed
this
cozy
little
spot
with
a
group
of
8
folks
.

service
was
excellent
.

food
was
excellent
.

wine
was

i
was
feeling
the
need
for
some
fish
so
i
had
the
salmon
which
was
very
good
but
the
steaks
looked
amazing
and
if
i
am
in
town
again
,
i
'll
definitely
order
a
steak
.

a
perfect
place
for
a
romantic
dinner
.

lots
of
"
pretty
people
"
dining
inside
.

great
staff
.

very
helpful
!!!!

they
interviewed
me
,
gave
me
tests
in
the
software
i
included
on
my
resume
,
and
placed
me
in
a
position
that
i
kept
for
several
years
.

re-interviewed
and
am
going
on
interviews
for
a
new
job
.

i
'm
really
thankful
for
the
folks
at
hr
office
.

they
are
dependable
,
have
great
connections
in
the
community
,
and
are
a
great
resource
for
finding
a
job
.

i
highly
recommend
them
to
all
of
my
friends
!!!!
!

great
experience
-
consider
checking
out
their
puppies
before
buying
from
a
breeder
!

i
adopted
a
3.5
month
old
yellow
lab
last
winter
from
the
dumb
friends
league
.

the
staff
was
very
helpful
in
finding
the
right
dog
for
me
and
the
care
my
pup
received
was
outstanding
.

if
you
are
on
the
lookout
for
a
pure
breed
pup
do
n't
forget
to
check
out
the
shelters
!

my
pup
has
a
wonderful
temperment
and
has
been
a
wonderful
addition
to
my
family
!

food
good
,
service
poor

no
silverware
,
asked
for
a
spoon
for
my
son
s
mac
and
cheese
ended
up
having
to
use
my
tea
spoon
.

asked
for
bar
-
b
-
que
sauce
never
got
it
.

never
checked
back
with
us
once
we
got
our
food
.

had
to
go
the
the
bus
boy
s
station
ourselves
to
get
napkins
.

only
one
server
,
too
buys
talking
with
others
i
guess
.

food
was
good
,
but
service
means
a
lot
to
me
.

dr.
chao
you
are
the
best
dentist
i
have
ever
had
.

you
are
knowledgeable
,
professional
,
gentel
and
kind
.

i
wish
i
had
you
as
my
dentist
early
on
in
my
life
-
maybe
my
teeth
would
have
been
a
lot
better
then
they
are
now
,
however
i
am
glad
you
are
my
dentist
now
.

even
though
you
are
expensive
.

thank
you
for
helping
to
preserve
my
teeth
.

you
are
meticulous
in
your
work
and
it
shows
in
my
smile
.

con
garage

i
brought
my
car
in
for
a
simple
emissions
test
.

i
guess
they
figured
me
for
an
easy
mark
,
and
tried
to
explain
that
my
car
would
n't
pass
unless
i
replaced
a
hose
.

ten
minutes
later
,
i
took
my
car
down
the
street
and
it
passed
the
emissions
test
with
flying
colors
.

if
you
're
a
fan
of
herpes
,
being
ripped
off
,
and
child
molesters
,
this
is
the
garage
for
you
.

if
not
,
go
somewhere
else
.

rude
service

even
though
i
have
never
tried
hoa
salon
but
i
agree
with
other
reviewers
that
they
are
rude
.

i
called
and
asked
about
the
price
for
hair
updo
and
the
receptionist
or
owner
who
aswered
the
phone
refused
to
tell
me
,
or
even
just
give
me
an
approximate
price
range
.

he
told
us
to
stop
by
the
salon
and
then
he
will
tell
us
the
price
.

what
kind
of
rude
service
is
that
?

i
do
n't
want
to
waste
my
time
with
them
.

top
notch
eats
!

so
here
we
are
in
manson
.

manson
?

yes
,
manson
.

right
near
chelan
.

aka
nowheresville
.

and
this
litttle
gem
of
a
7
-
table
restaurant
is
a
complete
and
utterly
wonderful
surprise
.

a
short
but
wide
-
ranging
menu
executed
with
innovative
perfection
in
a
cozy
hole
in
the
wall
just
off
the
main
street
.

fantastic
food
served
without
pretense
,
very
reasonably
priced
wine
selections
.

a
great
place
to
go
for
dinner
after
a
day
of
wine
tasting
.

excellent
service
and
reasonable
prices

boutique
stores
dealing
in
children
's
clothing
/
gifts
are
often
outrageously
priced
(
who
wants
to
pay
40
dollars
for
a
newborn
onesie
?
)

but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
that
the
purple
goose
's
prices
are
reasonable
(
for
the
same
products
found
at
other
area
boutiques
,
the
prices
were
20
-
25
%
cheaper
)
.

the
service
was
also
excellent
-
friendly
,
helpful
and
informative
without
being
overbearing
.

will
definitely
return
.

consistantly
poor

a
lack
of
organisation
,
coupled
with
the
distain
for
its
customers
,
makes
this
the
worst
rental
agency
i
have
used
.

chasing
them
on
issues
from
the
day
i
moved
in
(
many
of
them
still
unresolved
as
i
left
)
to
all
sorts
of
farcical
issues
with
funds
,
after
i
left
.
.
.
.
as
soon
as
i
could
.

if
you
must
use
them
,
be
vigilant
and
be
ready
to
push
,
if
you
can
go
elsewhere
then
i
would
.

amazing
night
-
great
party
spot
!!

went
to
the
willow
lounge
this
past
weekend
for
dinner
and
drinks
...
place
is
awesome
.

had
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
a
/
c
broke
,
i
feel
bad
it
was
their
opening
!

anyway
,
once
that
is
fixed
,
this
place
will
be
amazing
.

drinks
were
awesome
,
prices
reasonable
,
and
staff
friendly
.

this
is
an
awesome
date
spot
that
the
area
seriously
needs
.

check
out
the
willow
lounge
,
you
ll
be
happy
!

it
s
been
a
few
years
since
i
have
been
to
ipanema
.

but
my
wife
and
i
first
went
there
thinking
it
would
be
brazilian
food
(
think
lots
of
meat
)
,
but
it
turned
out
to
be
a
vegan
restaurant
!

and
,
i
can
say
,
this
was
one
of
my
favorite
places
to
eat
in
all
of
richmond
.

amazing
!

do
n't
let
the
nondescript
building
entrance
fool
you
,
these
are
some
creative
and
talented
chefs
...
two
thumbs
way
,
way
up
!

excellent
food
,
fantastic
wait
staff

i
recently
threw
a
surprise
birthday
party
for
my
wife
at
fraiser
's
.

we
had
30
guests
for
the
event
,
and
everyone
came
away
from
the
evening
impressed
with
not
only
the
food
,
but
the
outstanding
service
as
well
.

the
management
was
easy
to
deal
with
during
the
planning
stages
,
and
the
execution
by
the
kitchen
and
wait
staff
was
flawless
.

i
highly
recommend
fraiser
's
for
anyone
planning
a
special
event
for
friends
,
family
or
business
.

fantastic
store
!!!

i
came
upon
this
store
as
the
building
caught
my
eye
.

it
's
located
in
the
huge
honka
log
homes
building
,
by
walmart
off
of
evergreen
parkway
.

the
store
was
decorated
with
furnishings
&
accessories
.

the
friendly
crew
working
was
great
&
very
helpful
.

this
store
is
what
colorado
is
all
about
.

also
,
i
purchased
some
furniture
last
year
and
all
has
been
great
!

it's
durability
&
look
was
perfect
and
i
will
definitely
be
adding
to
my
collection
soon
!

lovely
people
,
great
hats

i
was
saddened
to
see
the
reviews
that
claimed
world
hats
mart
has
poor
service
.

it
led
me
to
believe
that
the
reviewers
simply
had
difficulty
tolerating
people
with
strongly
-
accented
english
.

the
husband
and
wife
who
run
this
spot
are
lovely
people
.

we
have
had
many
conversations
with
them
and
they
have
always
been
extremely
patient
with
me
as
i
tried
on
multiple
hats
in
search
of
the
right
costumes
for
my
magic
act
.

i
recommend
them
highly
!

do
nt
ever
go
there
,
not
even
if
your
car
flips
.

their
service
sucks
to
start
off
with
,
people
are
cruel
and
ignorant
.

i
'm
compeltly
dissatisfied
with
their
service
and
their
products
.

they
do
not
have
a
return
policy
and
even
if
their
product
sucks
,
they
will
not
take
it
back
!

do
not
ever
go
here
.

i
prefer
advanced
auto
parts
over
this
crappy
place
with
the
meanest
people
.

and
they
thrive
to
get
a
customer
.

do
not
go
here
..
thank
you

horrible

i
have
been
growing
my
hair
out
for
1
year
plus
and
went
in
to
get
1
inch
taken
off
.

i
walked
out
with
5
inch
long
hair
on
the
top
,
2
inch
long
hair
on
the
sides
,
and
1.5
in
the
back
.

my
hair
is
uneven
and
it
looks
rediculous
.

this
woman
should
be
working
in
supercuts
...
if
that
.

this
was
a
terrible
experience
and
i
hope
that
no
one
else
goes
through
that
.

do
your
self
a
favor
and
do
not
go
to
this
establishment
.

the
worst
burger
king
restaurant
!!!

i
generally
like
the
bk
over
the
other
fast
serving
restaurants
;
however
,
i
regreted
to
visit
this
restaurant
at
my
town
.

this
is
a
shame
of
my
adorable
town
,
branford
.

i
ordered
a
kid
meal
with
a
milk
and
found
a
bottle
was
half
opened
already
.

i
asked
them
to
change
it
but
they
rudely
said
that
it
was
okay
.

disgusting
french
fries
is
very
best
menu
.

do
n't
go
,
or
you
will
learn
how
to
waste
your
money
.

disappointed

the
bad
:
i
was
at
napa
recently
and
was
unpleasantly
surprised
at
poor
waiter
svce
and
subpar
food
.

we
were
a
party
of
4
and
none
of
us
were
particularly
pleased
with
our
dishes
.

napa
is
all
about
wine
but
gives
very
short
descriptions
of
the
wines
on
their
lists
.

i
found
my
initial
selection
satisfactory
but
the
wine
flight
we
chose
to
be
poorly
composed
.

if
you
must
go
ask
lots
of
questions
about
your
selections
since
your
expectations
may
as
high
as
mine
were
.

highly
recommended

we
walked
in
to
pick
our
little
man
at
10
minutes
to
closing
and
heard
laughter
from
kids
and
the
staff
.

the
facilities
are
more
than
adequate
and
the
staff
are
just
phenomenal
.

their
sense
of
humour
and
calmness
when
dealing
with
the
little
ones
amazes
me
every
time
i
walk
in
.

we
have
since
moved
slightly
further
away
from
the
centre
but
it
's
worth
the
extra
travel
,
as
the
care
provided
exceeds
our
expectations
...
especially
after
a
few
horrendous
daycare
experiences
elsewhere
.

horrible
!!!!
!

this
has
to
be
some
of
the
worst
pizza
i
have
ever
had
the
misfortune
of
ordering
.

the
crust
was
lopsided
,
thicker
on
one
side
than
the
other
.

it
actually
had
a
hole
in
one
of
the
slices
.

there
was
minimal
cheese
and
sauce
and
it
completely
lacked
flavor
.

i
know
new
york
pizza
and
this
is
not
it
!!

this
was
nothing
like
new
york
style
pizza
!!!.

i
love
pizza
and
this
was
a
complete
and
utter
disappointment
!!

i
would
not
suggest
this
pizza
to
anyone
!!!

best
quote
ever
my
gate
was
stuck
halfway
open
so
i
called
a
class
garage
doors
dr
services
.

they
came
to
my
house
in
no
time
and
started
working
on
the
gate
.

they
were
very
friendly
and
were
able
to
explain
me
exactly
what
was
wrong
with
it
.

once
they
fixed
it
they
answetred
all
of
my
questions
with
no
hesitations
and
then
gave
me
the
best
quote
ever
.

i
know
that
if
my
garage
door
needs
to
be
repaired
,
i
will
be
calling
a
class
garage
doors

you
will
be
happy
at
this
store
!

allen
tire
was
recommended
by
friend
after
my
having
bad
tire
experiences
in
temecula
.

the
store
manager
,
jim
smith
,
made
an
excellent
tire
recommendation
for
my
newly
acquired
lexus
.

tires
were
the
right
price
and
now
the
car
feels
like
it
is
riding
on
rails
around
turns
.

the
store
is
clean
,
run
very
professionally
and
a
pleasure
to
be
in
.

they
know
their
job
and
you
do
not
have
to
watch
them
to
be
sure
everything
is
done
right
.

easiest
time
i
ever
had
purchasing
a
car
!

excellent
service
,
not
only
did
they
get
the
exact
car
i
wanted
win
in
48
hours
but
the
sales
man
also
took
me
out
to
lunch
.

very
kind
and
reliable
.

i
highly
recommend
this
dealership
if
you
would
not
like
to
hassle
on
price
and
receive
friendly
service
.

i
have
since
purchased
two
cars
from
this
dealership
,
the
first
one
was
from
phillip
and
the
second
was
from
richard
.

both
were
excellent
sales
men
who
put
my
needs
first
.

this
place
has
done
a
great
job
of
taking
care
of
the
usual
maintenance
on
my
hooptie
.

i
also
never
have
to
wait
long
for
a
yearly
inspection
sticker
...
and
never
get
the
usual
excuses
other
shops
always
gave
me
...
"
the
inspection
guy
is
n't
here
today
"
....
for
example
.

today
i
went
into
kwik
kar
and
there
were
two
cars
in
front
of
me
for
inspection
...
but
i
was
still
out
of
there
pretty
quick
...
barely
had
time
to
read
a
chapter
in
my
book
.

extremely
helpful
and
professional

as
first
-
time
home
buyers
,
my
husband
and
i
found
stephanie
fairchild
at
prudential
steamboat
realty
,
extremely
helpful
.

she
worked
with
us
for
over
a
year
,
helping
us
find
our
perfect
home
.

stephanie
's
knowledge
of
the
market
and
properties
in
our
price
range
,
made
us
feel
secure
in
our
decision
to
buy
when
we
did
.

we
would
highly
recommend
stephanie
to
anyone
looking
for
a
home
in
the
yampa
valley
.

we
appreciated
her
patience
,
knowledge
and
kindness
!

great
barber

firstly
,
the
other
reviewer
clearly
has
never
been
to
nick
's
,
or
he
would
know
that
nick
only
charges
$
13
for
a
haircut
which
is
pretty
much
industry
standard
.

i
have
been
going
to
nick
for
5
months
now
precisely
because
he
does
pay
attention
to
detail
.

i
have
terrible
hair
and
he
really
takes
his
time
to
make
it
look
right
.

some
of
the
younger
kids
that
work
there
are
a
bit
sub
par
,
but
if
you
wait
for
nick
...
you
'll
be
good
.

ugh
!!!

got
some
nice
"
freshly
baked
"
fruit
squares
,
a
personal
favorite
of
mine
.

took
a
bite
,
it
tasted
odd
.

flipped
the
square
over
and
saw
it
riddled
with
green
mold
!!!!

ugh
!!

i
called
the
store
and
the
clerk
giggled
,
and
agreed
that
it
was
gross
,
but
said
it
was
not
her
problem
.

she
also
refused
to
get
a
manager
.

i
left
my
number
,
or
tried
to
anyway
.

same
clerk
had
considerable
difficulty
taking
down
a
number
.

i
'll
never
go
back
there
again

for
cheap
chinese
food
,
this
is
the
place
to
go
.

i
used
to
eat
at
places
like
new
china
or
green
buffet
in
troy
,
mo
-
nothing
terrible
but
not
that
great
.

now
,
i
wo
n't
eat
fast
food
chinese
unless
it
's
from
this
place
.

the
best
value
i
've
found
from
a
chinese
restaurant
.

i
do
n't
live
in
lake
st.
louis
anymore
,
but
deliveries
were
always
correct
and
the
service
courteous
.

now
i
have
to
be
in
the
area
to
get
some
lovin'
:
sad
face
:

amazing
experience
!

my
experience
was
amazing
at
providence
aesthetics
and
medical
spa
.

jana
kueck
was
nothing
but
professional
.

she
makes
you
feel
like
you
are
the
most
important
person
in
the
world
.

jana
made
me
feel
very
comfortable
.

provided
me
with
warm
blanket
and
has
soft
music
playing
.

walking
in
the
door
you
are
made
to
feel
happy
and
relaxed
.

equipment
is
state
of
the
art
.

i
would
reccomend
anyone
to
go
see
jana
kueck
and
robin
talley
to
see
all
the
many
procedures
they
have
to
offer
.

dave
is
a
patient
and
methodical
teacher
,
who
has
a
great
ear
and
sensitivity
for
his
students
'
passion
and
the
direction
they
want
their
lessons
to
take
.

also
,
he
loves
teaching
so
much
,
his
price
is
unbeatable
,
but
that
does
not
change
his
level
of
skill
.

dave
has
much
to
offer
.

in
just
2
-
3
focused
lessons
,
i
'm
already
now
capable
of
picking
up
new
songs
off
youtube
guitar
how
to
videos
and
am
even
writing
my
own
orginals
with
confidence

we
love
our
new
roof
!

we
would
like
to
thank
you
for
the
roofing
job
you
did
on
our
home
.

everything
was
done
on
a
timely
manner
and
things
were
cleaned
and
picked
up
every
day
when
the
crew
was
done
.

we
also
liked
the
way
that
ray
checked
on
the
job
every
day
.

and
when
the
job
was
done
every
thing
was
cleaned
up
and
hauled
off
that
same
day
.

we
would
not
hesitate
to
use
spears
roofing
again
.

we
have
already
recommended
you
to
some
of
our
friends
!

omfg

i
fucking
hate
this
place
every
time
i
go
this
hot
chick
shows
up
and
i
mean
really
hot
but
she
is
like
reaaaally
dumb
and
then
their
is
this
other
chick
that
is
realy
ugly
but
she
is
like
super
smart
she
could
be
a
scientist
,
but
then
their
is
this
stoner
who
always
comes
here
high
and
he
always
brings
his
fucking
dog
who
is
so
high
from
the
second
hand
smoke
i
think
he
is
trying
to
talk
.

anyway
we
drive
around
in
my
van
and
solve
mysterys
and
shit

amazingly
yummy
!

i
just
got
back
from
france
yesterday
and
just
missed
the
food
already
!

my
sister
in
law
told
me
about
this
amazing
new
crepe
place
in
town
,
i
was
so
excited
i
just
wanted
to
go
and
test
it
out
for
my
self
!

their
customer
service
was
perfect
!

their
food
was
better
then
anything
i
had
ever
tasted
.

even
in
france
!

i
would
highly
recommend
this
place
to
anyone
looking
for
a
great
atmosphere
,
amazing
food
,
and
great
customer
service
!

thank
you
roll
up
crepes
!

this
is
one
of
the
worst
places
i
have
stayed
,
we
cut
out
stay
short
and
went
to
the
mulberry
.

even
though
they
still
charge
you
the
days
you
booked
but
wo
n't
use
,
it
is
worth
the
get
the
hell
out
of
this
crap
hole
.

the
whole
experience
shows
a
hotel
managed
by
what
must
be
a
2
star
hotel
manager
.

bad
service
starting
from
the
front
desk
.

the
best
person
is
the
valet
.

short
of
that
,
avoid
this
place
,
as
a
silver
marriott
member
,
this
is
a
disgrace
.

best
place
in
ames

i
lived
here
for
two
years
when
the
prices
were
a
little
lower
:)
the
places
are
very
nice
and
clean
,
and
in
great
condition
!

i
really
enjoyed
the
staff
at
wessex
,
also
the
manager
sherri
was
always
very
nice
and
helpful
.

the
fitness
center
was
great
!

the
only
problem
that
i
had
in
2
years
of
living
there
was
that
the
walls
are
pretty
thin
,
sometimes
i
could
here
my
neighbors
conversations
.

i
would
recommend
these
apartments
to
anybody
!

i
absolutely
loved
living
there
.

the
best
service
ever
!!

i
have
never
had
better
service
.

my
car
broke
down
and
roadside
towed
my
vehicle
to
sussman
kia
.

they
squeezed
me
in
and
had
me
back
up
and
running
in
no
time
.

everyone
was
pleasant
and
very
helpful
.

the
service
department
even
gave
me
a
ride
home
and
picked
me
up
when
my
car
was
finished
.

the
advisor
kept
me
up
to
date
and
informed
on
the
progress
of
my
vehicle
.

i
give
this
dealer
an
a
+
!

i
will
definitely
be
bringing
my
car
back
for
service
.

heaven
on
earthhhhhhh

friendly
,
fine
food

the
one
-
star
review
from
2005
is
out
of
date
.

there
was
a
change
of
ownership
a
couple
of
years
ago
and
service
is
both
quick
and
extremely
friendly
.

the
food
continues
to
be
very
good
--
deli
sandwiches
,
homemade
soups
,
fresh
salads
.

the
atmosphere
may
not
be
for
everyone
.

it
is
a
bustling
place
where
separate
parties
are
seated
at
the
same
table
(
as
in
many
european
cafes
)
,
but
if
you
are
ok
with
that
,
the
food
is
very
good
.

love
the
soups
.

the
new
italian
kid
on
the
block

another
italian
restaurant
in
collingswood
?

do
we
need
another
one
?

only
if
it
is
of
the
quality
of
that
's
amore
.

the
menu
has
the
usual
but
then
they
step
it
up
another
notch
.

the
arancini
di
riso
(
risotto
fritters
)
are
not
to
be
missed
.

chicken
saltimboca
was
excellent
and
then
there
's
the
chocolate
mousse
that
comes
straight
from
heaven
.

pay
extra
attention
to
the
appetizers
-
the
next
time
i
go
there
i
'm
planning
on
ordered
a
few
instead
of
an
entree
.

auto
towing
is
one
of
the
best
towing
services
i
have
used
.

the
first
time
i
used
them
they
arrived
on
time
and
towed
car
for
me
to
the
destination
i
needed
.

the
auto
mechanics
that
work
for
auto
towing
are
very
friendly
and
informative
and
answered
any
question
i
had
.

they
have
towed
car
for
me
a
few
times
and
i
am
always
very
satisfied
with
this
services
.

if
you
are
looking
for
towing
services
that
can
offer
you
a
good
towed
car
service
,
then
auto
towing
is
the
company
for
you
.

a
very
satisfied
new
customer
!

as
a
very
satisfied
new
customer
,
i
wholeheartedly
recommend
united
air
duct
cleaning
.

they
are
professional
,
knowledgeable
,
and
take
meticulous
care
and
pride
in
accomplishing
their
work
.

not
only
were
my
wife
and
i
very
pleased
,
but
i
also
had
the
air
duct
quality
tested
professionally
by
the
home
inspector
that
i
regularly
use
,
before
and
after
united
air
duct
performed
their
work
.

based
on
the
test
results
,
the
home
inspector
stated
that
the
quality
of
their
job
was
"
excellent
"
.

the
best
breakfast
in
solana
beach
!

we
love
t
's
cafe
!

without
a
doubt
the
best
place
to
grab
a
tall
bloody
mary
and
some
eggs
benedict
.

t
's
has
been
a
north
county
landmark
for
thirty
years
and
with
good
reason
.

family
owned
and
operated
makes
sure
the
atmosphere
is
relaxed
and
the
food
home
-
cooked
with
style
.

i
highly
recommend
picking
up
a
jug
of
their
homemade
bloody
mary
mix
-
definitely
the
best
.

if
you
've
been
to
north
county
,
chances
are
it
's
in
your
favorites
list
already
.

prominent

prominent
builders
in
new
jersey
are
one
the
best
building
contractors
,
i
was
referred
to
them
by
my
friend
,
i
am
so
glad
i
used
them
for
my
home
renovation
,
and
addition
.

they
were
very
professional
,
respectful
,
completed
the
job
on
time
,
and
well
below
my
budget
.

mike
one
of
owners
was
awesome
,
he
explained
the
detailed
plan
,
and
executed
on
time
,
i
am
always
going
use
them
and
refer
them
to
many
friends
i
can
because
of
the
great
job
they
did
me
.

great
dude
cut
!

great
service
,
cool
vibe
,
impeccable
style
.

i
'm
a
guy
with
tricky
hair
so
getting
that
right
is
job
1
.

after
going
through
5
other
places
i
finally
found
janice
at
alta
moda
.

not
only
was
it
a
good
cut
but
my
wife
and
friends
comment
on
my
hair
every
time
i
leave
...
saying
it
's
the
best
look
i
've
ever
had
.

either
i
suck
at
my
own
style
or
janice
is
a
genius
.

looks
like
there
's
a
lot
of
talent
in
this
place
.

worth
every
penny
.

my
favorite
place
at
wildwood

i
have
been
going
to
the
wildwood
,
nj
for
over
30
years
for
summer
vacations
and
always
call
the
madrid
first
.

i
rated
it
5
stars
.

i
am
not
saying
it
is
a
5
star
hotel
.

i
am
saying
when
comparing
all
other
hotels
in
wildwood
,
this
hotel
has
everything
that
we
are
looking
for
.

it
is
the
hospitality
from
tom
and
staff
,
that
makes
it
feel
like
a
5
star
hotel
in
the
middle
of
the
beach
.

we
prefer
the
layout
of
rooms
and
it
is
always
clean
.

when
in
scordia
,
sicily

if
ever
in
sicily
please
take
the
time
to
visit
anna
maria
jose
mudo
and
her
familia
.

they
are
and
always
will
be
the
nicest
people
in
sicily
that
you
will
meet
.

you
will
also
have
the
pleasure
of
learning
the
italiano
language
.

you
will
also
have
the
experience
of
learning
the
bella
sicilian
culture
,
that
i
have
fallen
in
luv
with
.

i
will
4
-
ever
be
eternally
grateful
for
their
hospitality
and
luv
that
my
sicilian
family
showed
me
when
i
was
there
for
3
years
.

luv
always
..

i
've
never
felt
the
need
to
write
a
review
or
make
a
complaint
before
,
but
after
the
way
i
was
spoken
to
by
a
member
of
staff
at
the
kennels
(
whose
name
i
believe
to
be
mrs
closs
)
i
would
now
not
recommend
this
business
to
anybody
.

if
the
animals
are
treated
in
the
same
way
the
customers
are
treated
then
this
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
!

nobody
should
be
spoken
to
like
that
regardless
of
how
bad
their
day
may
have
been
or
what
may
be
going
on
in
their
private
lives
!

dealship
.

the
sales
men
were
very
knowledgeable
about
every
aspect
of
every
car
we
looked
at
.

they
were
very
patient
and
helpful
from
showing
the
cars
to
doing
the
paperwork
.

the
paperwork
was
a
very
easy
and
smooth
.

they
tried
to
run
my
credit
score
as
less
as
possible
so
it
wo
n't
hurt
my
score
.

overall
,
i
was
very
happy
with
the
customer
service
and
my
purchase
.

if
you
're
looking
to
buy
a
car
,
definitely
give
them
a
call
.

they
have
a
huge
inventory
.

i
have
been
a
patient
a
nw
hospital
and
it
was
great
.

i
have
also
had
an
80
yr
old
that
i
take
of
sent
to
the
er
and
long
stays
in
the
hospital
.

yes
,
we
had
to
wait
,
but
er
is
a
triage
system
that
takes
the
most
life
threatening
cases
first
.

any
er
would
be
the
same
.

as
far
as
being
treated
like
a
drug
seeker
,
that
has
not
been
my
experience
.

as
a
nurse
i
know
about
drug
seekers
.

this
is
a
great
hospital
and
even
better
since
it
became
part
of
the
uw
system
.

wonderful
experience

i
had
immense
pain
on
a
sunday
morning
,
with
friends
and
family
telling
me
that
i
would
never
find
a
dentist
on
a
sunday
.

dr.
taylor
was
not
only
available
on
a
sunday
,
but
also
was
able
to
immediately
take
care
of
me
.

he
was
incredibly
informative
about
the
options
i
had
,
giving
me
opinions
on
different
treatments
to
choose
from
.

coming
from
a
person
who
hates
the
dentist
in
general
,
dr.
taylor
was
the
best
!

he
really
made
the
visit
a
pain
free
one
with
excellent
service
!

i
would
recommend
him
to
everyone
!

horrible

this
school
is
the
worst
one
i
've
ever
been
to
.

i
attended
it
for
2
years
,
and
that
was
enough
.

there
's
holes
everywhere
in
the
ceiling
,
sewage
constantly
leaks
through
the
ceiling
,
and
the
whole
condition
of
the
school
is
horrible
.

the
staff
and
the
principal
are
rediculous
,
they
do
n't
listen
to
any
input
,
and
they
make
up
rediculous
rules
(
they
banned
backpacks
,
because
a
teacher
tripped
over
a
student
's
)
.

the
education
is
horrible
at
best
,
do
society
a
favor
,
and
do
not
send
your
student
here
.

excellent
customer
service
and
quality
work
.

they
went
the
extra
mile
to
repair
my
cowboy
boots
--
they
had
to
have
a
special
kind
of
paper
that
looked
like
wood
grain
to
fix
the
heels
.

that
was
4
years
ago
.

i
have
n't
been
able
to
find
a
shoe
repair
place
in
seattle
since
that
has
been
able
to
do
it
.

(
i
've
been
through
at
least
5
places
already
.
)

if
i
had
time
to
drive
to
tacoma
before
they
closed
during
the
work
week
,
i
would
just
so
i
could
get
those
boots
fixed
properly
again
.

so
handy
for
local
la
jolla
stuff
-
especially
for
finding
residential
numbers

since
moving
back
from
college
and
trying
to
settle
roots
in
the
village
,
i
have
referred
to
the
la
jolla
blue
book
for
a
ton
of
local
numbers
.

the
white
pages
allowed
me
to
get
in
touch
with
parents
of
my
high
school
friends
so
that
i
could
track
people
down
one
by
one
and
the
restaurant
section
is
basically
my
cookbook
.

it
's
really
cool
that
so
many
local
businesses
are
found
so
quickly
in
one
place
and
i
want
to
spread
the
word
.

thx
:-)

the
staff
do
occasionally
get
game
info
correct
,
but
if
you
r
looking
fot
a
good
game
and
are
n't
a
nerd
,
do
nt
ask
them
.

the
last
time
i
did
that
i
was
suggested
to
buy
oblivion
when
i
told
them
i
was
looking
for
a
fps
.

i
knew
what
it
was
and
told
the
guy
that
it
was
n't
a
fps
.

he
tried
to
tell
me
it
was
when
i
told
asked
him
if
he
knew
what
fps
stood
for
and
he
had
no
clue
.

overall
they
are
n't
very
knowledge
about
the
type
of
games
are
on
the
market
.

first
and
last
time
we
'll
eat
there

my
friend
and
i
went
there
for
lunch
today
.

neither
one
of
us
had
ever
been
-
so
we
thought
we
'd
try
it
.

big
mistake
-
the
food
was
tasteless
and
cold
.

we
both
kept
trying
to
find
something
we
liked
.

the
only
thing
i
found
edible
were
the
potato
wedges
,
i
finally
gave
up
,
he
kept
trying
-
he
found
the
fried
wantons
to
be
ok
-
his
mongolian
bowl
was
awful
.

would
not
recommend
this
place
to
anyone
-
in
fact
-
save
your
money
and
go
somewhere
else
.

liquidweb.com
rocks
!!!

i
am
not
a
client
of
liquidweb.com
,
but
one
of
my
friend
called
steven
is
the
client
having
several
websites
.

i
work
with
him
and
since
past
6
years
he
is
hosting
his
websites
to
liquidweb
.

as
i
have
gone
through
many
reviews
sites
to
see
if
any
provider
is
providing
better
services
or
not
,
and
i
have
realized
that
there
were
many
good
reviews
about
liquidweb
also
steven
never
faced
any
server
issues
in
his
whole
hosting
.

the
kind
of
support
they
provide
is
simply
great
!!!

i
would
like
to
host
my
upcoming
website
to
liquidweb.com

simple
but
perfect

if
you
want
flashy
fancy
food
stacked
high
with
lots
of
fussy
garnishes
,
this
is
not
the
place
for
you
.

if
you

perfectly
executed
simple
dishes
that
feature
a
few
exquisite
ingredients
,
you
'll
love

hands
-
down
the
best
pasta
and
gnocchi
i
've
ever
eaten
(
and
i
've
eaten
a
lot
)
.

the
antipasti
were
amazing
,
the
wines
were
mind
-
blowing
,
the
service
could
n't
have
been
better
.

i
've
dined
at
lots
of
high
-
end
restaurants
and
i
've
never
before
felt
my
money
was
so
well
spent
.

great
prices
,
great
service
!

i
've
been
to
this
shop
twice
(
once
for
an
inspection
and
again
for
an
oil
change
)
and
they
truly
live
up
to
their
name
:
discount
!

they
have
all
kind
of
coupons
available
for
car
washes
,
oil
changes
,
state
inspection
,
etc
.

the
thing
is
,
you
still
get
high
quality
service
at
nicely
discounted
rates
!

there
is
even
free
coffee
and
bottles
of
water
if
you
'd
like
.

the
owner
is
a
pleasant
guy
and
i
would
trust
my
car
with
him
or
any
of
his
workers
.

top
notch
,
all
the
way

david
is
amazing

david
is
the
most
helpful
and
creative
photographer
that
i
have
used
.

he
is
willing
to
do
whatever
you
need
from
him
without
hesitation
.

he
was
patient
and
adapted
when
everything
did
n't
go
according
to
schedule
on
my
wedding
day
.

both
the
engagement
and
wedding
pictures
that
he
took
for
us
we
absolutely
amazing
.

he
got
the
pictures
back
to
me
quickly
.

i
would
highly
recommend
david
to
anyone
.

he
will
exceed
your
expectations
!

he
does
n't
just
take
pictures
he
makes
art
out
of
them
and
you
wo
n't
even
notice
that
there
's
a
camera
there
.

not
so
great

my
husband
just
got
a
bike
there
as
a
gift
he
's
only
had
it
a
month
.

it
's
a
nice
bike
and
it
cost
a
lot
of
money
.

but
just
this
week
a
peddle
broke
.

he
took
it
back
and
they
would
not
honor
a
warranty
and
said
it
was
his
fault
because
of
his
shoes
??

so
they
were
going
to
charge
him
for
new
peddles
and
proceeded
to
put
them
on
without
even
telling
him
the
price
.

which
was
very
expensive
.

he
asked
for
a
different
pair
instead
and
they
only
gave
him
five
dollars
off
??

trek
is
not
so
great

only
concerned
with
money

i
have
been
getting
my
treatments
for
a
few
months
now
and
have
seen
some
results
but
not
up
to
the
standards
that
i
was
told
i
should
expect
.

the
people
there
attempt
to
come
across
and
professional
and
nice
,
but
i
was
disappointed
with
their
customer
service
.

never
miss
an
appointment
because
they
will
charge
you
the
price
of
a
treatment
,
even
if
you
had
an
emergency
.

it
's
pretty
ridiculous
!

they
want
to
squeeze
as
much
as
they
can
from
you
even
if
you
just
got
in
a
car
accident
!!!!

they
do
n't
care
one
bit
about
you
!!!!!

terrible
service
!!!

made
an
appointment
to
have
them
come
to
the
house
to
discuss
curtain
options
and
give
an
estimate
.

they
sent
over
someone
who
said
he
knows
nothing
about
curtains
and
could
not
show
me
fabric
options
or
give
an
estimate
.

when
i
called
the
manager
to
complain
,
she
said
she
knew
the
guy
did
n't
know
about
curtains
and
that
the
usual
lady
called
in
sick
hours
earlier
!

instead
of
rescheduling
they
chose
to
waste
my
time
instead
.

so
what
was
the
point
of
the
appointment
!?!

to
just
come
over
and
hang
out
?!?

i
will
never
do
business
with
this
company
!

ever
!!!

internet
department
is
rude
and
insulting

i
was
looking
to
bring
a
customer
to
their
lot
to
buy
a
car
but
the
internet
salesperson
last
name
is
balazick
sent
me
this
email
"
and
if
it
was
worth
my
time
i
would
of
bothered
aswering
your
questions
.

i
make
money
not
deal
with
brokers
"
wow
,
can
you
believe
in
today
s
tough
times
this
dealership
would
be
looking
for
any
way
to
move
vehicles
.

as
a
previous
internet
manager
i
would
deal
with
anyone
looking
to
buy
a
car
for
a
profit
and
not
care
if
they
came
in
with
a
broker
.

stay
away
from
this
dealership
!!!

this
place
is
a
rip
-
off

i
brought
a
car
in
to
have
the
"
check
engine
"
light
diagnosed
back
in
march
of
2010
.

they
said
it
was
"
plugs
and
wires
"
and
quoted
me
$
330
to
do
the
work
,
including
parts
.

i
asked
why
so
high
and
they
said
it
was
due
to
the
labor
of
moving
things
out
of
the
way
.

those
things
ended
up
being
a
windsheild
washer
fluid
tank
(
1
screw
)
and
the
air
filter
canister
(
4
spring
clips
)
.

i
did
the
work
myself
for
$
50
.

there
's
no
excuse
for
that
kind
of
estimate
.

my
girlfriend
and
i
took
a
chance
on
this
place
because
we
did
n't
want
to
wait
in
line
at
outback
.

what
an
amazing
find
-
this
restaurant
is
a
gem
.

1
it
s
immaculately
clean
.

2
the
decor
is
tasteful
and
artistic
,
from
the
comfortable
chairs
to
the
elegant
light
fixtures
....
and
(
most
importantly
)
3
the
food
is
fantastic
.

this
is
authentic
cuban
cuisine
;
fresh
ingredients
expertly
prepared
and
seasoned
perfectly
.

the
portions
were
generous
and
we
got
out
for
less
than
the
cost
of
one
entree
at
some
chain
restaurant
.

try
this
place
-
you
'll
love
it
.

thank
you
for
helping
me
get
more
healthy
!

i
came
in
and
saw
dr.
ruona
about
a
month
ago
for
quitting
smoking
.

i
have
to
tell
you
that
i
have
n't
had
one
and
do
n't
want
one
.

it
is
the
easiest
thing
that
i
have
ever
done
and
i
tell
all
my
friends
that
they
should
do
it
too
.

i
sent
a
customer
of
mine
to
you
.

dr.
ruona
,
if
you
read
this
,
thank
you
for
helping
me
get
more
healthy
.

i
feel
lighter
and
feel
that
i
have
more
possibilities
open
to
me
now
than
i
did
before
.

i
ca
n't
thank
you
enough

fantastic
for
kids

if
you
have
children
or
are
just
a
real
animal
lover
yourself
you
'll
love
this
zoo
.

it
's
only
$
10
and
in
essence
just
one
big
petting
zoo
.

they
sell
feed
and
milk
bottles
at
the
front
and
i
recommend
you
buy
lots
.

we
took
our
7
month
old
and
she
laughed
and
giggled
when
(
very
harshly
i
might
add
)
grabbing
and
'
kissed
'
the
goats
and
lambs
.

the
animals
were
all
very
sweet
and
patient
with
her
.

among
the
animals
that
were
available
to
touch
were
pony's
,
camels
and
even
an
ostrich
!!!

wonderful
,
inexpensive
and
lots
of
fun
!

wow
!!!

i
ca
n't
say
enough
good
things
about
karla
and
the
wonderful
things
she
has
done
for
me
and
my
dog
gracee
.

gracee
is
more
excited
to
see
her
than
she
is
to
see
me
!!!!

she
has
always
been
there
for
gracee
even
for
last
minute
calls
!

she
has
taken
care
of
my
sweet
girl
for
almost
4
years
now
and
i
would
not
let
gracee
go
with
anyone
besides
her
!!!

she
is
caring
,
punctual
,
and
very
enthusiastic
about
her
job
!

you
should
give
her
a
try
-
it
's
worth
every
penny
to
know
that
you
pet
is
in
great
hands
with
wunderbar
pet
sitting
!!!!

worst
service
i
've
ever
experienced

i
wish
there
was
something
good
to
say
about
the
business
,
but
unfortunately
,
there
is
n't
.

1
)
service
and
manners
were

exile
is
the
best
!!!

exile
is
the
longest
lasting
and
most
authentic
punk
store
in
richmond
!

i
have
been
shopping
there
for
over
six
years
now
.

the
staff
is
incredibly
friendly
and
helpful
and
the
owner
,
mimmy
,
is
an
absolute
angel
.

the
mark
up
is
minimal
considering
that
the
clothing
is
hard
to
find
and
often
shipped
for
europe
.

in
addition
,
the
clothing
is
of
much
better
quality
than
the
clothing
from
hot
topic
,
which
is
made
as
cheaply
as
possible
by
people
living
in
horrible
conditions
in
asia

exile
is
environmentally
conscious
and
involved
heavily
in
our

over-rated

buddakan
inevitably
attracts
the
majority
of
its
guests
simply
because
of
its
association
with
steven
starr
,
but
that
does
n't
impress
me
.

the
atmosphere
alone
deserves
4
stars
but
,
the
food
was
not
up
to
par
with
the
price
tag
and
the
reputation
the
restaurant
carries
.

the
server
we
had
was
knowledgeable
but
he
was
not
as
proper
as
he
should
have
been
,
acting
like
he
was
talking
to
his
friends
rather
than
his
customers
.

the
angry
lobster
was
completely
over-priced
!

$
80
for
a
dish
that
has
about
one
small
lobster
tail
and
is
full
of
filler
vegetables
!

i
would
n't
go
there
again
.

alto
delivers
on
all
levels
.

from
the
moment
you
enter
the
restaurant
,
you
know
you
are
some
place
special
.

the
service
is
impeccable
,
and
the
food
is
even
better
.

i
highly
recommend
the
four
-
course
tasting
menu
,
which
gives
you
plenty
of
range
and
food
to
satisfy
your
appetite
.

also
,
if
you
are
into
wine
,
alto
has
the
depth
of
both
region
,
varietal
,
and
vintage
to
satisfy
nearly
any
sommelier
(
or
after
9
pm
,
bring
your
own
bottle
for
free
...
no
corking
fee
!
)
.

while
it
's
not
cheap
,
alto
will
give
you
an
experience
you
'll
never
forget
.

the
landlord
is
not
nice
nor
helpful

i
have
lived
in
buckingham
condominiums
townhouse
for
2
years
.

i
love
the
location
and
the
apartment
!!

i
'm
a
single
female
and
i
feel
safe
coming
home
at
night
.

the
maintenance
people
are
awesome
!!!!

and
the
exterminator
is
very
nice
,
also
.

yes
,
you
still
have
a
few
bugs
,
but
that
's
going
to
be
anywhere
you
go
!

the
only
problem
that
i
have
experienced
is
the
landlord
.

she
is
a
pure
b****
!!!

i
know
that
's
ugly
...
but
she
wo
n't
help
you
out
for
anything
...
sad
story
.

other
than
that
,
i
would
recommend
living
here
.
:)

the
staff
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
.

the
front
staff
has
seen
quite
a
bit
of
turnover
and
changed
from
professional
to
rude
.

a
simple
follow
-
up
phone
call
with
a
woman
quickly
turned
into
a
nightmare
.

she
may
be
the
reason
for
all
the
change
.

i
sincerely
wonder
if
the
doctor
has
a
clue
about
what
is
going
on
within
his
practice
.

if
he
does
know
and
approves
of
this
behavior
then
it
is
a
poor
reflection
on
him
.

sometimes
it
is
not
worth
it
to
go
through
that
kind
of
staff
and
their
personal
attitude
to
get
to
a
doctor
.

he
was
an
okay
doctor
but
not
worth
her
.

i
would
give
the

ten

atop

,
from
the
decks
of
the
west
porch
,
"
one

see

"
a
scene
of
unparalleled
beauty
and
grandeur
.

i
saw
deer
frequently
,
in
fact
a
small
herd
were
grazing
near
the
lodge
.

there
were
occasional
bears
on
the
deck
in
the
morning
.

and
most
correctly
,
us
visitors
did
not
mingle
with
the

it
would
have
been
more
than

could

the

delightful

really
weird
place
,
i
was
driving
home
from
work
thought
i
'd
stop
in
for
an
oil
change
and
well
,
there
are
a
few
guys
in
jiffy
lube
uniforms
sitting
at
the
table
drinking
beers
and
shooting
the
breeze
.

the
neon
lighting
sign
still
said
"
on
"
yet
some
guy
who
seemed
to
be
the
oldest
of
the
bunch
,
more
like
the
drunkest
of
the
bunch
told
me
they
'd
be
open
tomorrow
.

i
asked
if
a
manager
was
on
duty
he
told
me
he
was
.

wow
!

of

a
friend
and
i
recently
took
our
16
and
18
month
olds
here
.

while
there
was
n't
too
much
available
for
their
age
(
ball
pit
,
bouncy
area
and
a
little
padded
pyramid
to
climb
on
)
,
we
went
right
when
they
opened
at
10
am
on
a
winter
weekday
and
ended
up
being
the
only
ones
there
,
so
we
were
given
a
little
more
liberty
than
we
would
have
if
others
had
been
there
.

it
's
not
the
classiest
place
,
but
it
was
cleaner
than
i
expected
and
the
staff
was
very
friendly
.

for
$
4
it
was
a
nice
break
from
the
monotony
of
winter
indoors
with
a
toddler
.

restored
my
faith
in
mechaincs
.

i
spent
3
months
going
from
shop
to
shop
trying
to
get
my
ferrari
to
run
and
drive
the
way
it
should
.

i
was
about
to
give
up
when
i
met
jason
and
neal
.

they
took
on
the
challenge
of
making
my
ferrari
all
i
dreamed
of
and
more
.

the
crew
at
the
creative
workshop
went
over
and
above
the
call
of
duty
and
gave
me
back
a
car
i
can
drive
anywhere
and
finally
enjoy
owning
.

i
can
not
say
enough
about
this
place
.

they
have
restored
my
faith
in
mechanics
.

do
yourself
a
favor
,
call
these
guys
first
and
enjoy
driving
your
car
again
..

a
great
vacation
!

we
wanted
to
see
the
sun
-
and
we
also
got
much
more
!

excellent
chefs
are
in
the
kitchen
preparing
memorable
breakfasts
.

after
a
train
ride
over
the
mountains
,
we
enjoyed
hiking
in
the
flower
-
filled
wenatchee
hills
(
in
may
)
and
a
very
interesting
bike
ride
in
a
loop
around
the
columbia
river
...
and
then
wine
if
we
wanted
it
on
the
patio
in
the
evening
....

this
is
a
busy
group
of
hosts
they
are
also
running
a
restaurant
,
which
also
must
be
wonderful
-
so
just
ask
for
what
you
need
,
and
i
'm
sure
they
will
do
their
best
to
be
hospitable
.

omg

omg
..
make
sure
to
book
a
reservation
,
as
this
magical
place
is
packed
(
in
a
nice
way
)
i
love
that
the
owner
walks
around
and
cares
how
his
customers
feel
about
their
food
.

the
waiters
are
like
no
other
...

my
waiter
was
so
excellent
i
gave
him
a
75
%
tip
,
and
it
was
worht
every
penny
..

the
food
was
finger
licking
the
bowel
fantastic
..

i
just
discovered
her
has
a
place
right
near
my
work
(
color
me
phat
)
if
you
are
looking
for
a
romatic
place
with
the
best
food
and
service
in
the
valley
giovanni
ristorante
should
be
your
number
1
+
2
choice
.

holly
is
truely
the
best
hairstylist
!

i
have
lived
in
the
utc
la
jolla
area
for
many
years
,
and
i
never
new
this
salon
was
here
until
a
friend
reffered
me
to
see
holly
here
.

i
was
very
pleased
with
my
experience
here
.

all
of
the
people
were
friendly
and
welcoming
.

i
got
highlights
,
haircut
,
and
a
blowdry
.

she
did
a
great
job
!

holly
is
very
experienced
and
talented
,
and
i
could
tell
she
new
what
she
was
doing
right
off
the
bat
.

my
hair
looks
amazing
,
and
i
get
compliments
all
the
time
.

i
deffenitly
reccomend
this
salon
and
holly
to
anyone
.

you
will
not
be
disappointed
!!!!!!

outdated
but
not
bad

so
i
really
felt
like
this
place
was
extremely
outdated
especially
since
the
pictures
make
it
look
nice
and
modern
.

it
had
listed
that
there
was
a
hot
breakfast
but
all
this
meant
is
that
they
added
a
waffle
maker
to
the
common
continental
affair
at
most
cheap
hotels
.

the
family
suite
was
basically
two
rooms
with
a
small
opening
between
them
which
worked
great
for
us
because
we
were
two
families
traveling
together
.

if
you
are
in
town
and
need
that
kind
of
space
i
say
stay
here
but
if
you
are
looking
for
a
little
more
upscale
affair
do
n't
let
the
pictures
fool
you
and
book
somewhere
else
.

great
,
and
probably
the
only
west
indian
spot
worth
hitting
up
in
nashville
.

i
was
born
and
raised
in
toronto
,
which
has
a
huge
west
indian
(
trinidadian
,
jamaican
,
etc
)
population
.

so
huge
in
fact
,
that
toronto
slang
is
influenced
by
and
has
jamaican
references
,
and
jamaican
beef
patties
are
staples
in
my
high
school
cafeteria
.

anyway
,
i
was
practically
raised
on
this
stuff
,
and
being
a
connoisseur
of
west
indian
cuisine
,
jamaica
way
is
a
bit
toned
down
to
suit
the
american
palette
.

all
you
have
to
do
to
make
it
authentic
jamaican
food
,
is
add
a
whole
lot
of
pepper
.

a
lot
.

the
finest
christmas
trees
i
've
ever
seen
.

i
felt
like
i
was
in
heaven
when
i
walked
through
the
majestic
fields
of
this
particular
farm
.

the
trees
were
in
magnificent
shape
and
the
variety
was
astounding
.

the
owners
were
entertaining
and
gracious
.

i
especially
liked
the
eco
friendly
atmosphere
and
the
owner
s
love
of
all
animals
.

this
is
one
of
the
best
farms
i
have
ever
been
too
.

i
would
call
it
the
taj
mahal
of
the
east
coast
!

it
put
hair
on
my
chest
and
thanks
to
the
owner
s
advice
i
invested
vanguard
,
got
myself
a
woman
like
jerry
,
and
became
a
republican
.

thanks

pho
-
nomenal
!!

i
have
been
eating
pho
for
almost
my
entire
life
and
i
've
always
gone
to
the
pho
places
in
south
philly
and
off
the
boulevard
and
even
the
other
one
in
chinatown
,
but
when
i
tried
this
pho
place
,
it
blew
the
other
pho
houses
away
!!

all
of
the
pho
places
taste
the
same
to
me
,
so
what
seperates
one
from
the
other
is
the
service
and
the
price
.

the
service
here
is
incredible
compared
to
the
other
places
.

the
only
down
fall
of
this
pho
house
is
the
difficulty
in
finding
parking
in
chinatown
.

remember
to
bring
cash
since
they
do
n't
take
debit
or
credit
.

hope
this
helps
!!

had
a
horrible
experience
with
a
manager
here
,
rachel
mcinnis
,
she
was
rude
,
inconsiderate
and
did
not
do
the
right
thing
for
an
item
that
was
marked
incorrectly
...

i
'm
not
interested
in
shopping
in
a
place
with
people
like
her
...
she
refused
to
sell
me
the
item
at
its
marked
price
even
after
admitting
they
had
made
a
mistake
.

i
normally
do
n't
write
reviews
but
seeing
that
i
considered
dillards
a
distinguished
,
upscale
place
to
shop
,
this
one
wo
n't
be
getting
my
business
,
nor
my
family
's
,
nor
my
co-workers
.

it
's
never
ok
to
let
a
customer
walk
out
unhappy
,
especially
when
they
are
right
.

highly
recommend

i
work
as
a
transformational
life
coach
.

since
this
is
an
alternative
therapy
i
always
refer
clients
to
a
lisenced
therapist
when
i
feel
that
is
appropriate
.

i
found
her
through
a
colleague
one
day
when
one
of
my
clients
was
in
the
midst
of
a
panic
attack
and
needed
professional
help
that
i
am
not
qualified
to
provide
.

little
did
i
know
that
i
would
soon
be
needing
her
help
as
well
!

she
guided
me
through
a
very
difficult
period
dealing
with
a
family
member
's
suicide
,
coupled
with
elder
abuse
.

i
found
her
to
be
extremely
solid
,
kind
,
compassionate
,
and
intuitive
as
well
.

i
would
recommend
her
highly
!

they
wo
n't
have
a
second
chance
from
me
.

first
,
let
me
state
that
although
i
live
in
nyc
,
i
am
not
from
nyc
,
i
do
n't
care
about
baseball
and
i
absolutely
love
boston
to
death
(
so
beautiful
,
so
clean
,
so
awesome
)
.

that
said
,
i
hated
this
restaurant
.

the
service
was
just
about
as
good
as
i
'd
get
in
nyc
(
that
means
it
was
poor
)
and
the
food
was
almost
mediocre
.

the
decor
left
a
lot
to
be
desired
and
the
posters
telling
me
all
the
reasons
99
was
great
just
served
as
an
ironic
contrast
against
the
reality
.

personally
i
recommend
you
take
your
money
elsewhere

when
i
arrived
at
brickell
honda
on
6/4/11
,
i
was
greeted
and
attended
to
by
the
sales
manager
,
gustavo
guerra
,
in
a
very
friendly
and
professional
manner
.

i
explained
to
him
what
i
wanted
and
that
i
previously
went
to
braman
honda
.

bramen
honda
was
a
bit
of
a
hassle
.

he
told
me
"
no
problem
,
we
will
match
the
offer
or
do
better
.
"

mr.
guerra
gave
me
a
better
deal
without
any
hassles
nor
any
type
of
problems
.

brickell
honda
has
been
the
best
buying
experience
in
the
world
.

i
urge
all
st.
thomas
the
apostle
parishioners
and
all
of
south
florida
residents
to
come
see
gus
!!!

excellent
customer
service
!!!

great
,
honest
service

i
took
my
2001
nissan
frontier
in
to
fix
a
cracked
manifold
.

the
dealer
wanted
$
1300
to
fix
that
and
another
$
1500
to
fix
some
other
things
.

eagle
transmission
determined
that
much
of
the
work
the
dealer
said
needed
to
be
done
was
unneccesary
and
what
needed
to
be
fixed
was
only
$
400
!!

i
was
so
impressed
with
the
honesty
and
integrity
of
mike
and
everyone
at
eagle
transmission
!

i
dropped
the
truck
off
in
the
morning
and
it
was
ready
that
afternoon
.

i
have
finally
found
a
mechanic
i
trust
!!

and
it
was
great
that
they
did
not
charge
a
service
fee
to
diagnose
the
problem
-
an
added
bonus
!!

the
next
time
you
feel
like
being
condescending
to
someone
,
it
is
not
going
to
be
me
!!!!!!

dr.
shady
is
inexperienced
and
prideful
.

she
probably
does
not
even
have
10
%
of
the
knowledge
that
some
of
the
other
experienced
vets
do
in
this
area
.

i
will
be
carefully
researching
vets
before
i
take
my
dog
someplace
else
.

beautifully
written
reviews
doctor
,
but
completely
untrue
.

poor
experience

i
did
not
have
a
good
experience
w
/
dr.
ghassemlou
.

during
the
session
,
he
demanded
to
have
my
physical
address
,
which
i
've
always
kept
private
as
i
am
enrolled
in
a
witness
protection
program
.

i
believe
he
is
correct
in
that
he
needs
my
physical
address
for
legal
reasons
,
however
,
he
did
not
adequately
explain
this
during
our
session
.

i
learned
more
about
this
doing
my
own
research
afterward
.

i
think
he
could
've
done
more
to
assuage
my
concerns
by
giving
me
concrete
facts
.

saying
that
i
need
to
give
him
my
address
or
else
i
have
intimacy
issues
is
not
helpful
.

it
's
pretty
combative
actually
.

you
'll
love
it

i
have
had
my
back
fused
in
2
places
.

i
wish
that
i
had
n't
done
this
.

with
these
fusions
,
chiropractric
is
n't
as
successful
,
but
it
still
is
very
helpful
.

even
after
my
fusions
,
my
back
continued
to
hurt
,
but
now
it
does
n't
hurt
any
more
.

i
would
encourage
anyone
who
is
thinking
of
back
surgery
,
to
talk
about
different
treatment
options
first
with
dr.
de
barros
.

he
really
knows
what
he
is
talking
about
and
will
approach
the
different
options
fairly
.

you
can
see
different
treatments
that
a
surgeon
ca
n't
see
,
so
that
you
can
have
several
treatment
options
before
you
decide
what
to
do
.

unbelievably
huge
experience
for
such
a
small
salon
!!!

i
have
been
to
kim
at
cheveux
for
more
than
five
years
.

i
can
not
tell
you
how
often
i
am
complimented
on
my
hair
(
style
and
color
)
!

i
regularly
request
kim
's
business
cards
as
i
am
often
stopped
on
the
street
and
asked
"
who
does
your
hair
...
i
love
it
!!!
"

quaint
,
lovely
,
small
salon
with
big
personality
.

i
am
made
to
feel
special
when
i
am
in
the
chair
and
i
have
never
had
a
less
than
amazing
cut
or
color
experience
.

my
hair
has
never
felt
this
healthy
,
either
.

i
can
not
recommend
this
salon
enough
!!!

thanks
cheveux
!

my
favorite
in
mclean

my
family
loves
coming
to
endo
sushi
.
they
are
very
nice
,
it
is
never
crowded
,
and
the
food
is
wonderful
,
very
delicious
and
fresh
!

sometimes
it
is
hard
to
get
parking
in
the
lot
in
front
of
the
storefront
,
and
it
is
on
a
one
-
way
street
,
but
the
restaurant
itself
is
never
overcrowded
.

if
you
can
not
park
in
the
lot
,
then
you
can
park
in
the
shopping
center
's
garage
,
and
walk
up
to
endo
sushi
.

the
service
is
fast
.

be
sure
to
ring
the
little
bell
on
your
way
out
if
you
enjoyed
your
meal
!

(
it
's
by
the
door
,
on
the
hostess
stand
)

horrible
service
!

i
got
yelled
at
,
literally
yelled
at
because
i
asked
if
i
could
pick
up
my
car
5
-
10
minutes
late
.

i
explained
that
i
was
already
on
my
way
and
i
would
rush
to
get
there
as
soon
as
i
could
because
i
needed
my
car
for
work
at
5
am
,
but
the
guy
was
arguing
with
me
saying
he
was
gon
na
lock
the
doors
right
at
5:30
.

rude
,
unprofessional
,
just
jerks
.

seems
like
all
they
care
about
is
the
money
and
getting
home
on
time
,
no
care
for
the
customers
at
all
!!!

missed
a
whole
day
of
work
because
i
am
now
carless
.

i
will
neeeeeeeeeverrrr
go
to
this
place
again
.

superb
arrangements

i
used
fancy
flowers
for
my
late
husband
's
funeral
flowers
as
they
had
been
recommended
to
me
.

i
am
so
glad
that
i
called
in
to
see
ana
,
she
is
a
lovely
girl
who
showed
nothing
but
care
and
compassion
towards
me
.

the
flowers
were
all
that
i
hoped
they
would
be
,
i
have
attended
several
funerals
of
late
unfortunately
and
the
flowers
i
recieved
from
ana
outshone
them
all
.

she
is
so
talented
,
the
flowers
were
arranged
superbly
and
delicately
,
it
is
so
obvious
to
see
the
difference
between
someone
fully
trained
and
skilled
compared
to
others
.

thank
you
ana
i
hope
to
see
you
in
the
future
under
better
circumstances
.

great
first
experience
.

i
'm
22
,
and
my
hairdresser
was
great
(
and
not
"
old
"
like
one
of
the
reviews
says
)
-
she
really
listened
to
what
i
wanted
and
gave
me
tons
of
tips
on
how
to
style
my
hair
so
i
could
get
it
to
look
the
way
i
wanted
it
to
.

she
deep
conditioned
my
hair
and
took
the
time
to
style
it
properly
.

she
recommended
products
but
absolutely
did
n't
pressure
me
to
buy
.

it
's
a
cute
place
with
a
really
friendly
,
laid
-
back
atmosphere
.

i
would
highly
recommend
it
and
will
be
going
back
for
my
next
haircut
.

oh
!

and
students
get
$
5
off
,
ca
n't
argue
with
that
.

smoker
s
haven

yeah
,
this
complex
is
not
very
good
.

our
bathroom
fan
,
one
electric
outlet
and
2
leaky
sinks
have
yet
to
be
fixed
.

both
bathrooms
look
like
they
were
flooded
and
the
wood
cabinets
are
thrashed
at
the
bottom
and
they
slapped
some
pieces
of
wood
over
to
try
to
cover
it
up
.

and
non-smokers
beware
!!!

i
think
90
percent
of
the
tenants
are
smokers
!

if
you
do
not
smoke
,
do
not
move
here
.

our
unit
reeks
of
old
cigarette
smoke
and
it
started
to
become
apparent
a
few
weeks
after
we
moved
in
.

you
can
not
walk
5
feet
without
smelling
that
disgusting
cigarette
smoke
and
it
blows
right
into
the
windows
all
day
and
all
night
.

great
sanwiches
,
great
prices

i
used
to
go
here
almost
every
day
since
i
work
in
the
neighbourhood
and
loved
their
turkey
and
meatball
sandwiches
.

chicken
salad
salad
is
great
too
.

best
of
all
,
the
staff
is
quick
on
their
feet
and
even
with
long
lines
,
usually
serve
you
in
5
minutes
or
less
.

for
the
quality
,
the
prices
(
$
4
-
$
6
)
have
to
be
the
best
in
town
.

the
staff
get
to
know
regulars
and
do
their
job
very
well
.

tourists
like
the
other
reviewer
might
not
appreciate
their
efficiency
or
quality
,
but
i
certainly
do
.

this
is
n't
a
tgif
or
cafe
,
it
s
a
lunch
sandwich
place
and
a
good
one
at
that
.

rate
a
church
?

might
as
well
just
hotpot
the
curb
and
rate
the
traffic
light
.

it
's
a
bloody
church
,
for
chrisssake
!

big
,
grey
and
imposing
.

go
there
on
christian
holidays
for
a
bit
of
churchy
grandure
.

the
pastor
at
this
church
is
cool
,
i
met
him
after
some
holiday
service
.

he
had
a
robe
that
was
made
back
in
the
'60s
.

god
was
pleased
with
that
one
!

it
's
historical
for
sf
,
so
when
your
aunte
comes
for
a
visit
,
take
her
there
.

great
for
the
kiddies
-
they
love
the
labyrinth
(
do
n't
forget
to
tell
'em
it
s
really
a
'
pagen
'
thing
!
)
.

stop
by
at
least
once
or
you
'll
go
to
heck
!

ok
but
just
becuse
we
where
on
a
tight
budget
.

me
and
my
dad
where
in
nj
for
a
kc
chiefs
(
my
home
team
)
vs
the
ny
jets
and
for
game
4
of
the
world
series
.

i
'm
a
red
sox
fan
so
i
was
glad
that
the
phillies
won
.

the
knights
inn
was
small
very
small
.
i
mean
1
room
in
every
room
!
it
was
cozy
a
little
and
a
small
tv
.

i
mean
a
2
day
stay
was
a
ok
stay
even
tho
the
manager
looked
like
he
was
chineze
and
that
we
only
slept
and
went
out
from
8
to
7
to
see
new
york
.

but
sice
we
almost
just
slept
there
i
ca
nt
give
that
good
of
a
review

it
was
a
saturday
and
my
spring
was
broken
...

i
googled
garage
door
repair
in
woodinville
and
found
ndi
-
johnette
answered
the
phone
and
was
oh
-
so
pleasant
and
helpful
!

she
sort
of
appologized
for
dan
taking
the
day
off
to
go
skiing
-
but
he
could
do
the
repair
on
sunday
!

i
said
great
and
dan
arrived
on
time
at
10
am
to
make
the
repair
.

i
enjoyed
speaking
with
dan
,
and
learning
more
about
how
the
springs
are
sized
for
these
doors
.

the
repair
went
quickly
and
the
price
was
extremely
fair
.

i
would
highly
recommend
ndi
-
and
will
spread
the
word
to
my
neighbors
.

thanks
dan
and
johnette
for
your
responsiveness
and
professional
service
.

roger
m.
,
woodinville

i
would
n't
send
my
dogs
there
.

i
had
a
conversation
with
the
woman
running
this
place
in
april
2010
.

she
basically
said
if
the
children
getting
off
the
bus
are
n't
paying
to
enter
her
building
she
was
going
to
let
them
wander
around
the
streets
.

wow
,
really
?

with
all
the
child
predators
out
there
,
a
busy
road
,
cars
speeding
by
......
and
you
are
going
to
let
some
4
/
5
year
olds
wonder
around
cause
you
're
money
hungry
?

real
christian
of
you
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

whether
they
pay
me
or
not
,
if
their
parents
get
into
an
accident
,
stuck
in
traffic
,
etc.
the
last
thing
i
would
do
is
let
a
child
get
raped
because
i
was
n't
paid
.

excellent
service

i
could
easily
go
to
nordstrom
for
my
designer
jeans
and
pay
the
same
price
,
but
i
go
to
the
garment
district
for
their
service
.

previous
reviewers
said
they
were
pushy
and
i
can
understand
that
,
but
i
find
the
staff
more
helpful
than
anything
else
.

tiffany
is
fabulous
!

i
came
in
for
alterations
(
free
,
by
the
way
)
and
told
her
about
a
stain
i
had
on
my
new
leather
purse
.

she
immediately
went
to
the
back
,
brought
out
leather
cleaner
and
cleaned
my
purse
on
the
spot
.

i
did
n't
even
buy
the
bag
there
!

huge
selection
and
,
great
suggestions
from
the
staff
and
they
refer
you
to
reliable
places
if
they
do
n't
have
what
you
need
.

we
were
expecting
a
great
experience
,
when
we
recieved
a
friendly
greeting
by
the
hosts
.

the
atmosphere
was
nice
and
very
clean
.

the
menu
had
plenty
of
options
even
for
picky
eaters
.

the
service
was
ok
,
our
waitress
kept
forgetting
our
drinks
even
though
we
reminded
her
several
times
.

to
start
we
tried
the
guacamole
and
salsa
verde
,
it
was
completly
flavorless
.

we
should
have
left
then
.

we
orderd
our
meals
anyway
,
chimichangas
,
jalapeno
borritos
,
and
quesadillas
.

everything
was
bland
,
completely
void
of
any
spice
or
flavor
.

we
have
never
had
mexican
food
this
bad
,
it
was
just
simply
gross
.

hopefully
they
spice
things
up
or
they
wo
nt
be
in
business
long
.

i
recommend
la
hacienda

might
try
again

pros
:
*
jill
,
the
owner
,
is
very
nice
and
really
cares
about
her
feedback
*
pretty
nice
atmosphere
*
great
dessert
*
not
your
typical
veggie
selection
,
i
like
!

do
n't
know
where
else
you
can
find
purple
hull
peas
and
some
of
the
other
sides
.

cons
:
*
server
was
n't
very
pleasant
*
pretty
small
portion
on
the
blackened
catfish
*
overcooked
food
*
time
,
took
about
25
minutes
from
ordering
to
eating
.

half
the
tables
and
bar
were
empty
by
this
point
.

other
thoughts
:
will
try
this
place
again
.

there
must
be
a
reason
so
many
people
like
it
there
.

their
club
sandwich
looks
tasty
,
maybe
that
'll
change
my
mind
....
and
a
different
server
.

very
professional
/
very
helpful

the
people
at
fidelity
leasing
were
very
friendly
and
helpful
.

i
was
looking
for
a
car
but
did
not
really
know
what
i
wanted
and
they
were
very
helpful
and
took
the
time
to
first
figure
out
what
my
needs
were
and
showing
me
various
options
to
meet
those
needs
.

they
seemed
more
interested
in
helping
me
find
the
right
car
rather
then
just
make
a
sale
.

my
experience
with
them
was
great
-
low
stress
,
very
helpful
and
very
personal
.

after
finding
the
car
i
wanted
they
took
the
time
to
go
over
each
step
and
making
it
as
painless
as
possible
.

from
start
to
finish
they
were
top
notch
.

i
would
highly
recommend
calling
these
people
up
for
your
next
car
.

this
insurance
co.
is
a
joke
!!!

they
have
absolutely
no
communication
skills
whatsoever
.

if
you
do
n't
mind
being
robbed
,
cheated
or
lied
to
then
this
is
the
company
for
you
.

they
will
make
every
attempt
to
misinform
and
misrepresent
themselves
.

they
make
up
excuses
in
hopes
to
confuse
their
policy
holders
with
misinformation
.

as
an
example
they
took
payment
for
5
out
of
6
monthly
plan
premiums
for
a
yearly
policy
and
cancelled
the
contract
for
the
remainder
of
the
policy
for
reasons
they
stated
was
not
receiving
information
on
other
licensed
drivers
in
the
household
?

i
personally
provided
the
request
on
four
separate
occasions
and
they
claim
there
is
a
glitch
in
their
systems
?

ifa
is
an
acronym
for
i
m
a
f%#king
assh@%$e
!!!

fantastic
service
!

i
have
been
here
a
few
times
for
oil
changes
and
just
got
my
tires
,
alignment
and
state
inspection
done
yesterday
.

i
shopped
it
around
and
they
were
extremely
competitive
in
pricing
and
also
added
nitrogen
to
my
tires
which
should
extend
the
life
and
get
me
better
gas
mileage
.

it
also
came
with
free
balance
and
rotation
for
the
life
of
the
tires
!

what
made
it
perfect
was
that
they
offered
transportation
so
that
i
would
not
have
to
wait
there
or
take
time
off
of
work
to
go
back
and
forth
or
try
to
find
a
ride
.

great
service
,
great
pricing
and
super
convenient
!

i
also
did
not
feel
like
they
tried
to
sell
me
a
bunch
of
services
that
i
did
not
need
.

love
my
home
at
creekside

i
moved
to
creekside
apartments
in
august
2008
with
a
6
-
month
lease
and
have
just
extended
it
for
another
13
months
!

the
management
from
julie
and
janice
to
the
work
staff
,
esp.
edwin
,
are
just
wonderful
.

they
have
been
extremely
helpful
whenever
i
have
asked
for
help
.

although
the
apartments
are
facing
stokes
street
and
close
to
the
bascom
light
rail
,
the
location
is
surprisingly
quiet
.

i
have
never
had
any
problems
with
loud
neighbors
or
concerns
about
safety
.

the
apartments
are
within
walking
distance
to
trader
joe
's
,
whole
foods
,
and
other
stores
.

the
well
-
equipped
,
clean
gym
is
a
plus
!

great
place
to
live
if
you
work
in
and
around
downtown
san
jose
!

i
interviewed
several
contractors
for
a
kitchen
remodel
.

liberty
construction
shows
up
and
it
's
two
guys
...
all
i
get
is
100
%
sales
pitch
"
we
're
the
best
...
we
're
number
50
so
we
must
be
doing
something
right
...
look
at
all
these
certificates
that
say
we
're
great
"
.

not
once
did
i
feel
listened
to
like
they
actually
cared
about
what
i
wanted
,
all
they
were
interested
in
was
me
signing
a
contract
right
then
and
there
.

very
high
pressured
sales
and
with
the
reviews
of
many
others
bad
service
.

i
'm
glad
i
trusted
my
gut
and
did
n't
get
sucked
into
doing
business
with
them
.

find
someone
you
trust
that
actually
hears
you
and
wants
to
do
the
job
right
.

do
n't
waste
your
time
or
money
!

i
took
my
3
year
old
son
here
at
the
weekend
and
to
be
honest
,
apart
from
the
shark
walkway
,
i
thought
it
was
rubbish
and
overpriced
.

even
taking
into
account
the
fact
that
my
3
year
old
wanted
to
run
most
of
the
way
round
,
it
took
us
just
over
one
hour
start
to
finish
.

if
you
have
been
to
the
london
aquarium
i
would
not
even
bother
with
this
.

if
you
are
really
desperate
for
something
to
pass
the
time
and
are
willing
to
shell
out
the
best
part
of
l
30
for
2
two
people
then
go
for
it
.

(
for
some
reason
it
will
not
let
me
rate
it
one
star
-
it
is
not
rated
5
by
me
!

cranmore
dental
and
implant
clinic
:
i
could
not
recommend
dr
david
nelson
enough
.

i
had
a
severe
phobia
of
attending
the
dentist
until
i
met
and
was
treated
by
dr
nelson
.

he
instantaneously
put
me
at
ease
and
his
ongoing
treatments
have
been
absolutely
pain
free
.

my
previous
apprehension
has
been
dismissed
and
i
no
longer
have
a
sinking
feeling
when
my
next
appointment
is
due
!

in
addition
to
the
core
treatment
,
dr
nelson
has
impressed
me
further
with
his
concern
and
interest
in
the
well
-
being
of
his
patients
-
his
dental
work
underpinned
by
a
strong
duty
of
care
to
every
patient
.

he
is
always
prepared
to
go
the
extra
mile
to
ensure
that
any
patient
discomfort
is
dealt
with
immediately

best
salsa
(
hehehe
)

after
my
trees
were
cleaned
up
,
they
gave
me
a
jar
of
salsa
.

the
owner
warned
me
that
it
was
the
best
salsa
i
would
ever
had
,
and
he
was
right
.

no
joke
!

i
hate
to
say
check
them
out
just
for
the
salsa
,
but
james
,
i
need
another
jar
badly
:)
all
kidding
aside
,
they
are
a
very
good
company
,
i
have
a
hard
time
giving
any
service
biz
a
5
star
review
but
they
came
close
.

very
affordable
(
do
n't
call
it
cheap
)
and
their
trimmers
were
quick
and
courteous
when
i
got
home
from
work
.

and
the
salsa
,
be
sure
to
ask
for
a
jar
and
have
plenty
of
chips
around
,
you
will
need
them
.....

dr.
mann
killed
our
pet

yea
,
dr.
mann
ai
n't
so
great
.

we
took
our
beloved
kitty
to
him
and
it
came
back
dead
.

we
live
in
the
sub-division
around
the
corner
and
after
it
happened
and
we
brought
it
up
at
some
neighborhood
gatherings
we
discovered
that
several
people
from
this
neighborhood
alone
had
pets
go
to
dr.
mann
for
surgical
procedures
and
came
back
dead
.

if
you
take
him
here
for
shots
,
no
big
deal
but
i
would
never
let
this
man
apply
anesthetic
to
my
pet
ever
again
.

oh
,
they
also
charged
me
for
the
procedure
(
$
250
)
and
had
the
audacity
to
charge
me
a
$
25
'
disposal
'
fee
.

they
actually
itemized
it
as
a
disposal
fee
.

avoid
at
all
costs
.

one
of
the
worst
places

this
place
and
its
sister
store
peking
garden
are
the
worst
places
to
order
from
.

the
food
was
horrible
not
cooked
like
it
should
be
,
they
got
the
order
wrong
on
a
number
of
occasions
,
and
once
forgot
about
my
order
.

i
had
to
call
back
up
there
two
hours
later
and
the
lady
(
who
claimed
to
be
a
manager
)
said
my
food
was
on
the
way
,
and
she
did
nt
offer
to
compensate
me
in
any
kind
of
way
.

i
waited
another
30
mins
before
receiving
my
food
and
it
was
cold
.

in
my
opinon
this
place
should
be
shut
down
by
the
health
inspector
,
and
anyone
who
is
satisfied
with
there
service
and
food
has
never
eaten
at
a
real
asian
restaurant
.

gone
downhill
since
change
in
ownership

sigh
.

i
used
to
love
this
place
.

but
now
that
they
are
part
of
a
chain
,
service
has
slipped
.

i
am
waiting
longer
at
bna
for
my
pickups
and
last
time
i
parked
with
them
,
they
lost
my
car
key
.

lucky
i
had
a
spare
with
me
!

to
date
they
have
not
made
good
by
either
finding
the
key
or
paying
for
a
new
one
.

(
these
new
car
keys
are
expensive
to
copy
,
you
ca
n't
just
go
to
walmart
.
)

go
to
the
website
for
coupons
and
join
the
club
-
you
can
get
free
parking
.

however
,
with
bna
offering
one
day
of
free
parking
due
to
construction
of
the
new
rental
car
facility
,
it
may
be
cheaper
to
park
at
bna
.

wife
and
i
attempted
to
adopt
a
dog
and
was
nothing
but
frustrating
.

we
arrived
sunday
at
about
230
and
found
a
do
we
really
liked
.

we
were
told
that
we
could
n't
today
because
they
were
closing
soon
.

i
called
the
next
morning
to
let
then
know
my
wife
would
be
driving
in
.

they
gave
me
the
run
around
and
missing
paperwork
only
to
call
back
to
tell
me
someone
else
wanted
her
and
i
would
need
to
come
in
and
put
down
a
deposit
.

i
work
2
hours
away
but
offered
my
card
over
the
phone
.

they
refused
.

terrible
communication
as
well
.

at
one
point
they
told
me
the
dog
had
been
fixed
,
the
next
day
it
had
n't
.

huge
ammount
of
time
wasted
time
and
elevated
blood
pressure
.

college
is
a
joke
and
the
salon
is
a
joke
!

went
to
the
school
here
over
priced
!!!!!!

you
do
not
learn
the
things
you
were
promised
.

you
have
to
bring
in
your
own
models
and
they
have
to
pay
for
you
to
use
them
if
you
do
nt
then
you
can
graduate
!

going
back
after
graduating
you
r
told
you
get
a
discount
on
services
nope
you
do
nt
.

staff
is
under
educated
.

going
there
you
learn
the
school
does
not
care
about
the
services
given
just
about
the
money
.

over
priced
for
students
to
learn
!

beware
of
the
nail
program
you
are
not
taught
to
use
a
nail
drill
at
all
you
learn
the
old
fashioned
way
of
doing
nails
you
will
not
be
able
to
do
well
in
a
salon
!!!

beware
!

you
can
fool
people

this
store
is
proof
that
you
can
fool
people
with
good
advertising
.

they
convince
lots
of
people
that
they
are
a
great
store
,
when
in
fact
they
are
a
very
average
place
at
best
,
they
are
just
another
big
box
store
like
the
others
.

they
offer
sales
that
are
n't
really
sales
,
mislabeled
items
that
make
the
item
sound
like
a
good
deal
when
it
is
n't
,
a
bad
attitude
about
return
items
,
and
on
and
on
.

with
higher
than
average
prices
to
boot
!

so
do
n't
get
taken
in
,
keep
your
eyes
open
if
you
choose
to
shop
here
.

on
the
other
hand
,
the
richmond
ukrops
chain
is
known
for
its
charity
work
,
its
community
action
,
and
its
interest
in
the
public
welfare
.

never
again

do
n't
go
here
unless
you
want
to
sit
,
order
,
eat
and
be
asked
to
leave
all
in
a
matter
of
20
minutes
.

you
wo
n't
even
have
time
to
read
the
entire
menu
before
being
asked
to
order
and
if
you
ask
for
more
time
your
server
will
wait
at
the
table
.

this
is
the
only
place
i
have
ever
eaten
and
been
told
to
leave
because
other
people
were
waiting
.

i
was
told
to
take
my
coffee
to
go
if
i
wanted
to
finish
it
.

oh
,
and
their
liquor
license
was
expired
so
no
bloody
mary
or
mimosas
.

plus
the
drinks
are
self
service
,
have
fun
trying
to
negotiate
the
small
cafeteria
space
to
get
your
coffee
,
juice
or
water
.

go
next
door
to
the
ball
square
cafe
instead
.

i
guess
you
get
what
you
pay
for
.

i
tried
to
stay
here
for
a
few
nights
with
my
girlfriend
,
so
we
asked
for
a
single
queen
bed
.

we
got
there
,
and
we
were
treated
to
the
free
"
upgrade
"
of
a
room
with
two
double
beds
.

since
they
consider
this
an
upgrade
,
they
let
their
other
rooms
fill
up
and
would
not
change
our
room
.

then
we
got
put
in
a
room
with
a
huge
gap
under
the
door
....
right
next
to
the
ice
machine
.

we
could
hear
every
single
thing
that
happened
outside
like
it
was
inside
our
room
.

when
i
finally
found
someone
at
the
desk
who
could
speak
english
,
they
moved
our
room
,
but
we
still
did
not
receive
the
single
queen
we
had
"
reserved
"

i
was
thoroughly
impressed
!

i
had
a
problem
with
the
tile
in
my
bathroom
coming
apart
.

i
called
a
few
different
businesses
in
the
area
to
get
estimates
,
they
were
n't
the
cheapest
i
found
but
very
reasonable
.

the
best
part
is
i
got
my
whole
bathroom
remodeled
for
about
the
same
price
the
other
compan's
were
quoting
just
to
fix
the
shower
tile
and
fixtures
.

they
had
the
work
done
in
about
half
the
time
quoted
which
made
me
and
my
wife
extremely
happy
.

we
have
had
nothing
but
compliments
on
our
bathroom
when
guest
come
over
-
who
would
have
guessed
that
one
?

very
nice
work
and
friendly
guys
too
.

best
money
i
've
spent
on
remodeling
ever
.

i
highly
recommend
any
one
considering
home
repair
to
give
these
guys
a
call
.

new
training
centre
is
excellent

the
award
dance
centre
has
moved
from
its
holderness
road
site
to
a
new
complex
on
chamberlain
road
hull
.

the
new
centre
has
4
studios
planned
and
now
boasts
the
largest
single
dance
floor
area
in
kingston
upon
hull
.

the
classes
cover
all
age
and
skill
ranges
,
with
ballroom
,
latin
,
sequence
,
street
,
disco
,
line
dancing
,
ballet
,
tap
&
jazz
.

we
have
attended
a
ward
dance
centre
for
over
a
year
and
really
enjoy
the
friendly
and
welcoming
way
we
are
taught
ballroom
and
latin
as
well
as
the
fun
filled
social
dance
evening
held
every
saturday
evening
....

it
is
not
really
possible
to
score
this
school
too
highly
,
we
would
give
it
12
out
of
10
and
5
stars
across

&
anne

i
purchased
a
2
-
year
old
certified
pre-owned
bmw
from
this
dealership
.

the
night
i
drove
back
home
,
i
found
that
the
rear
window
has
some
leakage
.

(
you
can
hear
the
wind
while
driving
on
highway
.

very
likely
it
needs
a
new
window
seal
)
.

i
admit
that
i
should
have
paid
attention
to
this
kind
of
little
things
while
test
drive
.

(
but
this
is
a
certified
car
from
a
dealer
.
)

so
i
brought
the
car
back
the
second
day
.

they
told
me
that
this
is
not
under
warranty
and
want
to
charge
me
$
175
just
to
diagnose
the
problem
!

who
knows
how
much
they
want
me
to
pay
to
fix
this
thing
.

i
walked
away
.

so
my
advice
is
that
never
trust
this
dealer
.

stay
away
as
far
as
possible
.

perfect
practice

after
i
had
chosen
the
fountain
dental
practice
they
provided
a
slick
and
professional
service
from
start
to
finish
.

everyone
was
friendly
from
the
receptionist
to
the
surgeon
herself
,
putting
me
at
my
ease
and
explaining
the
whole
process
,
both
initially
and
then
as
we
went
along
.

surgery
visit
timings
were
always
made
to
suit
me
and
not
them
and
they
gave
me
the
feeling
that
i
mattered
and
was
important
to
them
.

the
surgery
itself
is
slick
,
modern
and
very
relaxed
and
i
always
felt
that
i
was
in
capable
hands
.

my
dental
surgeon
,
dr.
lucy
nichols
is
clearly
a
dental
perfectionist
and
clearly
proud
both
of
the
work
she
does
and
the
reputation
she
has
established
.

everyone
was
so
helpful
that
i
can
not
wait
to
go
back
.....

wonderful
service
for
large
group

i
had
my
wedding
luncheon
at
this
bj
s
restaurant
,
and
it
was
one
of
the
best
choices
that
i
made
.

it
was
a
great
deal
--
we
paid
a
certain
amount
per
person
,
and
my
husband
and
i
chose
4
types
of
pizza
and
the
servers
brought
out
as
much
as
we
wanted
.

we
were
also
served
salad
and
soda
.

we
had
a
large
party
,
about
fifty
people
or
so
,
and
yet
everything
was
served
quickly
and
we
all
had
a
wonderful
time
.

even
though
we
were
only
supposed
to
have
those
specific
types
of
pizza
,
when
guests
asked
for
a
different
type
,
it
was
brought
out
with
no
charge
to
us
!

i
really
appreciate
bj
s
for
making
that
special
day
even
better
with
their
wonderful
food
and
service
.

wonderful

i
went
to
ohm
after
reading
some
of
the
reviews
.

i
go
to
school
in
the
area
and
usually
wait
until
i
go
home
to
get
my
hair
cut
.

i
decided
it
was
time
to
grow
up
and
made
an
appointment
.

sierra
was
my
stylist
and
i
love
what
she
did
.

i
have
wavy
hair
and
she
cut
to
my
hair
style
.

it
was
the
first
time
i
had
left
a
salon
with
my
hair
curly
.

usually
they
blow
dry
it
out
and
i
have
to
wait
until
i
wash
it
to
see
what
it
will
look
like
in
its
natural
state
.

but
she
did
a
fabulous
job
letting
me
know
what
she
was
doing
at
all
times
and
styled
my
hair
in
a
way
i
could
do
it
at
home
.

it
was
n't
completly
impossible
!!!!

i
am
definitely
going
back

after
recently
relocating
to
south
bend
,
we
were
looking
for
a
delicious
,
fun
,
yet
elegant
establishment
for
new
year
s
eve
dinner
.

we
were
disappointed
with
this
holiday
dinner
due
to
the
overall
flavor
and
price
of
the
meal
,
and
accessibility
to
the
jazz
club
.

the
meal
was
extremely
overpriced
and
lacked
flavor
,
especially
for
being
a
special
nye
menu
.

the
limited
menu
had
few
appetizing
options
and
the
nye
special
packages
were
way
overpriced
.

after
our
meal
,
our
server
found
us
a
table
in
the
jazz
club
where
we
were
informed
it
would
be
another
$
10
/
person
to
stay
and
listen
to
the
band
,
despite
the
fact
we
had
just
finished
a
dinner
there
and
were
intending
to
enjoy
their
drink
list
.

this
was
a
less
than
impressive
experience
at
trio
's
.

run
for
the
hills
...
you
'll
be
much
better
off
!

one
night
was
too
much
.

first
room
had
used
tissues
next
to
the
bed
and
i
requested
it
be
rectified
.

i
was
then
moved
to
another
room
around
the
back
where
the
room
was
dirty
,
the
shower
was
dirty
with
other
people
s
hair
in
it
,
the
toilet
seat
was
peeling
and
rough
and
the
bathroom
was
full
of
mould
.

i
called
reception
to
ask
if
they
knew
the
state
the
room
was
in
and
was
told
"
this
is
a
days
inn
,
not
the
hilton
"
and
the
receptionist
then
hung
up
on
me
.

to
warn
you
to
stay
away
from
this
place
just
is
n't
enough
.

there
was
not
one
ounce
of
caring
involved
and
anyone
i
can
warn
about
the
complete
lack
of
service
will
be
warned
.

grocery
and
daily
needs
store

before
using
fusionretail
before
installing
fusionretail
store
was
running
on
a
dos
based
software
.

we
were
having
a
major
problem
in
maintaining
cash
.

being
a
grocery
shop
,
maintaining
5000
different
products
was
a
challenging
job
.

managing
pos
counter
without
barcoding
was
really
a
tough
time
.

how
fusionretail
has
overcome
these
issues
?

fusionretail
helps
us
to
maintain
the
store
in
an
organised
way
.

usage
of
product
barcodes
and
smooth
maintenance
of
inventory
with
proper
recording
of
transactions
like
sale
,
purchase
and
returns
was
never
easy
before
.

how
long
does
it
take
to
train
new
people
at
work
?

billing
takes
15
minutes
and
back
office
jobs
takes
1
day
's
training
how
fast
your
support
queries
get
answered
?

over
telephone
,
immediate
.

on
call
,
it
takes
a
day
to
get
our
issues
resolved
.

ca
n't
wait
to
go
back
!!!

this
is
by
far
the
best
b&b
that
we
have
ever
stayed
at
!

we
were
in
santa
fe
for
a
special
event
and
our
hosts
rented
out
the
el
paradero
for
all
their
guests
to
stay
at
.

we
could
not
have
been
more
welcomed
,
more
comfortable
or
more
well
fed
.

the
weekend
was
perfect
in
every
way
,
in
large
part
to
sue
and
her
great
staff
.

everyone
was
so
friendly
and
really
went
out
of
their
way
to
make
sure
everything
went
well
.

we
can
not
wait
to
go
back
to
santa
fe
and
to
this
great
b&b
...
especially
my
4
year
old
,
who
made
friends
with
ms.
sue
and
all
the
ladies
,
and
has
talked
about
them
since
we
left
!

we
would
highly
recommend
the
el
paradero
on
your
next
trip
to
santa
fe
!

disatisfied
customer
,
i
went
through
kitchen
aid
and
used
one
of
their
recommended
vendors
.

a&e
came
out
,
charged
$
129
fee
just
to
walk
in
the
door
.

i
needed
a
part
for
my
appliance
,
the
cost
was
very
high
so
i
said
never
mind
,
paid
the
fee
and
called
a
local
business
for
a
second
quote
.

the
second
vendor
charged
$
55
(
less
than
half
of
what
a&e
charges
)
to
come
and
applied
that
to
the
price
of
the
repair
service
(
which
a&e
does
not
)
.

their
quote
came
in
at
half
the
price
of
a&e
for
the
same
work
and
same
part
.

seems
to
me
like
a&e
charges
way
more
than
necessary
!

very
disappointed
in
kitchen
aid
as
well
,
i
thought
that
they
pre-screened
their
vendors
for
price
and
quality
of
work
,
obviously
they
do
not
!

lovely
nails
on
cayuga
st.
in
lewiston
,
ny

first
let
me
start
out
by
saying
,
that
i
have
had
very
nice
pedicures
at
lovely
nails
on
military
road
.

i
was
very
excited
that
a
salon
was
opening
in
lewiston
,
as
i
live
in
youngstown
.

i
was
in
two
weeks
ago
and
had
the
worst
pedicure
that
i
have
had
in
my
life
.

there
were
four
of
us
and
i
was
taken
first
by
a
gentleman
.

i
put
my
foot
in
the
water
and
it
was
cool
.

he
did
warm
it
up
.

he
also
hurt
my
toes
will
pushing
my
cuticles
back
.

if
the
pedicure
lasted
20
mins.
,
that
was
a
stretch
.

the
other
ladies
had
a
similar
experience
,
both
had
nail
polish
on
a
couple
of
toes
.

none
of
us
will
be
using
their
services
again
,
which
is
a
shame
.

good
service
-
limited
results

andrew
was
helpful
and
knowledgeable
about
acupuncture
re
:
infertility
.

he
was
willing
to
talk
to
me
about
my
specific
issues
and
develop
a
plan
of
action
.

the
office
is
shared
with
a
foot
doctor
and
it
's
very
sterile
and
medical
feeling
,
which
i
liked
.

the
down
side
was
that
sometimes
there
was
a
lot
of
noise
in
the
hallway
from
other
patients
/
doctors
.

i
worked
with
andrew
for
2
months
and
did
acupuncture
and
herbs
.

the
sessions
were
nice
and
i
felt
relaxed
after
them
but
did
not
notice
any
changes
with
my
cycles
.

i
know
it
can
take
a
while
for
results
and
did
n't
expect
a
miracle
,
but
after
2
months
i
felt
like
it
was
not
entirely
worth
the
cost
/
time
.

(
i
am
also
a
little
suspicious
of
all
these
glowing
reviews
...
)

friendly
,
clean
and
excellent
location

the
staff
was
very
helpful
,
and
gave
us
good
advice
on
day
and
night
time
activities
.

common
room
was
comfortable
and
clean
,
very
good
room
to
read
or
relax
.
-

a
great
breakfast
which
was
included
every
morning
until
9:30
am
;
yummy
fresh
parisian
croissants
.

comfortable
and
clean
beds
,
a
bit
noisy
when
people
were
coming
in
late
from
a
night
out
,
but
we
did
n't
mind
too
much
as
we
were
also
just
coming
in
from
a
night
out
!

the
location
is
really
stellar
!

it
is
next
to
gare
du
nord
and
a
five
minute
walk
to
sacre
coeur
which
is
excellent
for
shopping
.

it
is
close
to
bus
lines
for
opera
plaza
,
galleries
lafayette
,
and
the
famous
flea
market
.

we
really
enjoyed
our
stay
and
would
definitely
stay
at
the
vintage
hostel
again
.

just
autos
thank
you
!

was
fast
and
easy
,
just
had
our
car
returned
this
morning
,
i
would
recommend
these
mobile
mechanics
for
sure
.

they
certainly
know
what
they
are
doing
.

the
mechanic
came
to
our
place
and
sorted
out
our
car
s
problems
,
he
explained
the
problem
and
was
very
up
front
and
honest
,
it
was
towed
to
the
workshop
as
the
gearbox
was
not
working
(
he
explained
it
better
)
.

they
phoned
the
same
day
,
confirmed
it
was
the
gearbox
quoted
me
the
job
,
i
gave
the
go
ahead
.

now
my
car
s
gears
and
brakes
have
never
run
so
well
...
ever
it
s
like
driving
a
new
car
.

so
yes
,
i
would
n't
hesitate
in
recommending
the
team
at
just
autos
for
easy
professional
car
repairs
,
thank
you
just
autos
for
your
help
.

i
stopped
in
today
@
yards
brewery
.

i
must
say
,
i
was
impressed
with
the
size
of
the
bar
area
and
lounge
,
&
i
liked
that
you
could
see
the
brewery
right
thru
the
glass
!

i
had
a
sampler
of
ipa
,
brawler
,
love
stout
&
esa
.

all
were
awesome
,
&
i
had
a
dogwood
grilled
cheese
which
was
enjoyable
with
the
fine
beers
.

after
my
sampler
&
sandwich
,
i
asked
for
a
pint
of
there
nitrogen
love
stout
,
i
must
say
i
was
impressed
,
with
the
great
taste
&
i
am
a
guiness
lover
so
coming
from
me
,
i
think
this
is
better
,
it
s
less
dry
&
smoother
!

if
you
are
in
philly
you
have
to
come
check
this
place
out
!

the
only
negative
i
have
abou
this
place
is
the
parking
!

i
left
with
a
case
of
brawler
!!!!

oil
change
disaster

my
wife
had
taken
her
'07
ford
fusion
in
for
a
routine
oil
change
.

a
couple
days
after
the
oil
change
,
the
engine
ran
rough
,
the
low
oil
pressure
light
would
come
on
sporadically
,
and
the
engine
would
whir
loudly
.

turns
out
the
engine
had
no
oil
,
and
when
oil
was
put
it
,
it
would
just
run
out
of
the
filter
.

there
could
have
(
hopefully
does
n't
have
)
major
damage
to
the
engine
.

all
of
this
started
after
their
oil
change
.

once
they
realized
their
mistake
they
sent
a
mechanic
and
tow
truck
to
my
wife
's
work
and
towed
it
back
to
fix
it
.

i
would
not
recommend
this
shop
for
anything
,
not
even
something
as
simple
as
an
oil
change
.

plus
they
will
overcharge
you
for
just
about
everything
,
and
smile
while
doing
it
.

liars
,
negative
stars
!

took
my
cruze
in
twice
for
poor
fuel
economy
.

the
first
time
they
claimed
to
get
reasonable
mpg
.

however
,
they
would
never
drive
the
car
with
me
in
it
to
prove
their
findings
.

i
wonder
if
they
were
going
down
a
hill
!

they
told
me
to
bring
it
back
after
5000
miles
.

i
brought
it
back
with
9000
miles
.

they
"
finished
"
the
work
and
told
me
the
car
was
ready
.

i
found
out
they
did
not
even
drive
the
car
,
stated
they
looked
at
it
before
.

they
still
would
not
drive
the
car
with
me
to
show
their
mpg
number
.

they
also
claimed
not
to
see
anything
wrong
with
the
blower
fan
(
a
seperate
issue
)
,
but
when
i
drove
the
car
home
i
had
the
same
symptoms
.

i
will
never
purchace
another
vehicle
from
vic
canever
.

great
job

i
want
to
say
that
mike
did
a
great
job
for
our
family
in
our
time
of
need
.

both
my
grandparents
passed
away
4
months
apart
and
mike
was
very
understanding
.

it
was
a
very
trying
time
for
my
family
and
myself
yet
mike
took
the
time
to
greet
each
and
every
one
one
of
us
.

he
is
very
professional
in
his
position
as
a
director
and
yet
he
still
made
time
to
be
compassionate
for
what
we
were
all
going
through
.

i
'm
sure
it
s
not
every
day
that
a
funeral
director
sees
the
same
family
in
such
a
short
time
.

my
grandfather
passed
away
silently
in
his
sleep
,
and
my
grandmother
passed
away
after
a
short
struggle
with
cancer
.

both
my
grandparents
looked
as
natural
as
could
be
expected
.

thank
you
mike
for
all
your
help
professionally
and
personally
.

poor
service

if
you
like
the
drama
described
in
popular
sitcom
'
seinfeld
'
,
you
will
see
it
here
.

we
signed
our
name
in
about
6:00
pm
.

there
were
3
names
before
us
.

the
greeter
said
there
was
about
15
minutes
waiting
.

however
,
we
waited
and
waited
and
in
the
mean
time
,
saw
4
groups
of
people
simply
just
paraded
in
without
signing
there
names
.

this
sign
in
policy
is
posted
by
the
restaurant
"
no
reservation
,
sign
your
name
here
"
.

i
had
to
ask
the
greeter
,
he
explained
his
reasons
with
broken
english
.

i
could
not
understand
any
his
reasons
.

i
could
only
take
it
as
they
would
seat
the
people
they
know
first
.

my
conclusion
is
that
you
should
only
go
there
if
you
want
to
wait
a
least
an
hour
and
see
all
kinds
other
people
being
seated
before
you
.

instructor
never
showed
up
!

january
15th
--
we
were
signed
up
for
saturday
's
2
pm
class
"
beginning
yoga
with
brittany
.
"

we
even
arrived
10
minutes
early
as
the
website
suggests
.

the
instructor
did
not
show
up
!

we
waited
until
2:25
pm
and
then
left
.

there
were
2
in
our
group
,
and
a
3rd
person
was
also
in
the
parking
lot
waiting
for
this
class
.

well
,
not
much
i
can
say
except
i
'm
very
disappointed
with
this
experience
.

this
was
our
first
visit
to
your
studio
.

in
today
's
instant
world
,
there
's
no
reason
for
the
instructor
not
to
even
have
given
us
a
phone
call
or
e-mail
if
she
was
going
to
be
late
.

as
a
yoga
studio
,
i
'm
sure
you
're
all
aware
that
all
actions
generate
karma
.

and
sometimes
karma
can
manifest
itself
on
a
bad
review
on
google
.

finest
??

really
??

i
beg
to
differ
.

this
place
is
marginal
at
best
.

not
very
welcoming
and
focused
mostly
on
keeping
little
kids
entertained
.

i
was
not
impressed
,
and
quite
frustrated
at
their
lack
of
rating
for
their
courses
.

i
understand
not
wanting
to
put
labels
like
5.10
on
an
indoor
course
,
because
yes
,
it
is
not
the
same
,
but
some
clear
understanding
of
the
difficulty
of
one
course
to
another
is
nice
when
you
are
an
intermediate
climber
looking
to
improve
.

i
do
n't
want
to
waste
my
time
on
routes
set
for
children
,
but
i
do
n't
want
to
take
on
something
i
ca
n't
handle
just
to
strain
myself
to
exhaustion
.

rate
the
routes
,
with
understandable
markings
and
a
more
detailed
system
than
easy
,
moderate
,
and
hard
.

again
,
a
great
outing
for
the
kids
,
a
frustration
for
an
out
of
town
climber
.

best
dj's
in
town
!

wow
!

these
guys
were
the
best
.

they
were
thorough
,
high
class
,
and
went
above
and
beyond
.

we
never
had
to
worry
about
a
thing
,
and
they
led
the
way
the
whole
time
.

they
asked
us
things
that
we
would
have
never
have
thought
of
,
and
took
extra
time
to
meet
with
us
when
we
needed
it
before
the
wedding
.

having
a
team
was
the
best
because
they
kept
the
flow
of
the
wedding
going
the
whole
time
!

they
may
look
young
but
do
n't
let
that
fool
you
,
as
their
knowledge
of
music
far
surpassed
what
we
expected
.

i
am
a
music
junkie
that
grew
up
in
the
80's
,
and
my
dad
worked
for
a
record
label
in
the
1960's
.

so
we
did
n't
expect
them
to
even
know
some
of
the
requests
that
we
asked
that
night
.

they
just
really
know
their
stuff
!

never
fear
going
to
the
dentist
again
!

i
'm
61
years
old
and
have
dental
problems
my
entire
life
.

by
the
age
of
24
i
stopped
going
to
the
dentist
.

my
fear
and
discomfort
from
dental
work
scared
me
!

it
took
all
the
courage
i
could
muster
to
make
an
appointment
.

at
the
front
door
of
his
office
,
i
nearly
turned
around
.

i
considered
just
leaving
after
going
inside
and
nearly
did
.

doctor
gonzales
and
his
entire
staff
are
the
most
professional
people
i
have
ever
dealt
with
.

they
made
me
feel
confident
in
what
they
would
do
,
and
treated
me
like
a
member
of
their
own
family
.

i
never
felt
pain
or
discomfort
.

the
ability
to
smile
and
eat
again
can
only
be
described
as
a
whole
new
lease
on
life
.

thank
you

horrible
service
and
food

not
only
is
this
place
too
expensive
for
what
it
is
,
it
s
horrible
!

in
the
past
,
i
got
a
steak
and
there
was
more
fat
and
rough
pieces
than
there
was
good
steak
(
and
this
was
the
sirloin
!
)
,
the
sides
were
drenched
with
butter
and
the
salad
was
a
little
on
the
brown
side
.

today
we
went
for
a
party
(
during
lunch
,
so
the
place
was
empty
)
with
about
25
other
people
.

it
took
over
1.5
hours
for
our
food
to
come
out
and
by
that
time
my
8
month
old
had
it
!

does
it
seriously
take
that
long
for
a
soup
and
salad
?

i
was
a
waitress
for
years
and
a
key
rule
is
to
serve
customers
with
small
children
before
others
,
as
i
was
the
last
to
get
my
food
.

i
would
not
recommend
having
a
party
here
or
even
going
here
.

texas
roadhouse
is
way
better
!!

spay
and
neuter
service
.

i
have
no
doubt
that
the
rescue
is
wonderful
.

but
i
had
my
cat
spayed
through
their
reduced
/
free
spay
and
neuter
program
and
the
vet
they
sent
us
to
was
first
of
all
a
hour
and
a
half
away
,
and
4
days
later
we
had
to
bring
them
to
our
normal
vet
because
the
vets
at
the
place
in
wisconsin
did
a
crappy
job
and
they
got
infections
.

my
vet
even
said
it
was
not
my
fault
it
was
the
vet
that
did
the
surgery
,
so
i
would
not
recommend
getting
that
program
unless
you
have
an
extra
hundred
dollars
or
so
for
antibiotics
and
a
vet
visit
.

you
'd
think
they
would
do
a
good
job
but
they
do
n't
care
unless
they
are
getting
paid
full
price
.

which
is
so
dumb
.

not
to
mention
the
fact
that
they
gave
us
our
cats
back
not
even
30
minutes
after
they
were
out
from
surgery
.

billing
issues
...

i
had
a
routine
surgery
for
an
ingrown
toenail
.

my
insurance
company
,
blue
cross
/
blue
shield
paid
the
fees
and
everything
was
fine
.

then
i
got
a
bill
for
$
483.00
.

the
doctor
's
office
said
that
payments
had
been
"
reversed
"
.

blue
cross
has
no
record
of
aa
reversal
.

the
office
refused
my
requests
to
see
what
they
got
from
bc
/
bs
.

they
eventually
turned
it
over
to
a
collection
agency
and
now
will
not
even
discuss
the
matter
.

i
eventually
decided
to
just
pay
the
balance
even
though
the
doctor
has
already
been
paid
,
but
now
the
collection
agency
is
trying
to
say
another
reversal
of
$
160.00
has
come
through
.

it
was
an
ingrown
toenail
.

how
much
could
it
possibly
cost
?

not
only
am
i
being
bilked
for
money
i
do
not
owe
,
the
office
staff
is
rude
to
boot
.

i
think
this
office
has
some
serious
billing
practice
issues
!

we
have
been
blessed
to
find
elite
flyers
online
and
would
not
use
anyone
else
to
handle
our
postcards
,
posters
,
etc
.

we
were
looking
for
a
company
with
decent
rates
as
our
company
was
just
getting
started
.

they
have
the
best
rates
and
great
customer
service
.

on
one
order
,
we
needed
it
rushed
and
shipped
to
a
different
state
.

they
did
that
with
no
problem
.

i
also
appreciate
their
honesty
.

i
sent
a
graphic
that
would
have
been
distorted
if
printed
as
it
was
.

they
called
and
worked
with
me
to
fix
it
so
that
it
would
look
perfect
.

they
recently
surprised
me
a
larger
order
.

i
ordered
1000
postcards
,
we
normally
order
5000
or
more
.

because
they
had
room
to
do
5000
,
they
created
the
larger
amount
,
and
shipped
them
early
.

i
recommend
this
company
to
anyone
and
everyone
that
needs
great
work
done
at
a
reasonable
rate
!

they
have
a
customer
for
life
in
us
!

sheisters

i
made
the
mistake
of
buying
from
these
thieves
.

i
paid
2
k
cash
for
a
truck
with
a
blown
motor
.

their
so
called
mechanic
said
the
engine
was
good
and
"
there
is
nothing
mechanicly
wrong
with
this
truck
"
.

well
i
think
a
blown
engine
falls
under
the
catagory
of
mechanics
right
?

anyway
they
jimmy
rigged
it
so
i
could
drive
it
home
.

the
next
day
i
took
it
to
2
auto
shops
and
they
both
told
me
the
same
thing
,
engine
is
junk
.

i
called
and
got
the
same
runaround
on
hold
and
noone
calls
you
back
.

from
a
moral
standpoint
,
you
guys
are
really
gon
na
take
2,000
bucks
from
someone
that
needs
that
truck
to
work
and
support
his
family
when
you
know
it
s
just
a
piece
of
scrap
metal
?

if
it
lasted
1
month
i
could
suck
it
up
but
1
day
?

grimy
work
you
guys
do
.

buy
your
kids
somethin
nice
with
my
2
k
bucks
.

best
stationery

in
bethesda

papeluna
,
a
cute
mom
/
pop
custom
printing
and
paper
store
,
just
opened
a
few
days
ago
.

it
is
right
on
the
hustle
and
bustle
of
wisconsin
ave
but
some
might
miss
it
as
it
is
nestled
in
between
subway
sandwiches
and
modell
's
.

i
popped
in
after
my
afternoon
pumpkin
spice
latte
break
at
starbucks
.

it
's
an
adorable
little
store
filled
with
lots
of
stationery
goodness
.

cards

,

,
and
an

to
sit
down
and
talk
with
someone
to
design
your

or
for
whatever
else
your
custom

needs
may
be
.

i
gave
the

i
spoke
with
today
a
"
you
've
been

"
card
to
let
her
know
that
yelp
may
be
a
good
tool
for
helping
spreading
the

about

i
ended
up
buying
a
birthday
card
and
would
probably
come
back
for
more

watch
out
for
your
wallet
!

this
company
is
overpriced
for
their
services
.

they
pride
themselves
on
being
an
event
and
team
building
company
for
corporate
clients
but
you
better
believe
they
are
going
to
mark
you
up
on
that
feel
good
premise
.

on
a
recent
event
quote
that
i
had
done
,
they
came
in
thousands
of
dollars
over
their
local
competition
.

the
craziest
part
is
that
they
are
n't
even
based
locally
at
the
city
i
'm
in
-
they
just
have
'
teams
'
in
areas
through
the
country
.

i
've
spoken
to
vendors
who
are
used
by
them
who
had
nothing
good
to
say
about
the
company
as
well
and
in
fact
were
afraid
to
quote
events
against
them
even
though
they
openly
admitted
that
they
felt
canadian
outback
was
pricing
their
entertainment
out
of
the
market
and
doing
more
to
hurt
their
business
than
help
them
.

be
warned
-
they
'll
ltake
you
for
everything
they
can
.

believe
me
.

this
is
the
premier
university

orr
's
a
nightmare
!

do
n't
go
!

my
boyfriend
and
i
were
woken
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
at
our
campsite
by
drunken
kids
who
'd
arrived
around
1:00
am
and
were
drinking
at
the
springs
.

when
we
complained
to
the
management
(
as
we
were
instructed
to
do
if
there
were
any
problems
)
,
nothing
happened
!

then
,
the
next
morning
,
when
we
,
among
many
other
irate
guests
,
asked
to
speak
to
the
owner
,
he
refused
to
do
so
.

not
only
that
,
but
he
told
us
,
via
his
manager
,
that
it
was
our
responsibility
to
get
up
a
second
time
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
call
the
night
staff
if
the
problem
continued
,
even
though
his
manager
did
nothing
the
first
time
to
stop
the
kids
.

orr
is
not
relaxing
,
it
's
not
a
safe
space
,
and
the
owner
is
awful
.

to
add
insult
to
injury
,
he
refused
to
refund
our
money
.

do
n't
go
!

fhs
is
a
good
high
school
--
c
/
o
1998

i
enjoyed
my
time
at
franklin
high
school
.

we
had
relatively
good
facilities
at
the
time
--
decent
science
labs
,
with
multiple
hoods
and
access
to
good
equipment
;
nice
gymnasiums
,
and
a
well
-
funded
music
department
(
i
was
in
the
guitar
ensemble
)
.

now
,
of
course
,
there
's
a
new
building
,
with
presumably
better
facilities
.

all
to
the
good
.

for
those
who
care
,
a
good
proportion
of
the
my
class
went
on
to
4
-
year
colleges
,
many
of
them
ranked
in
the
top
50
of
us
news
.

if
i
remember
,
students
went
to
dartmouth
,
u.
penn
,
duke
,
bu
,
william
and
mary
,
vassar
,
howard
,
and
carnegie
mellon
,
among
others
.

many
students
went
to
rutgers
,
including
their
top
-
ranked
pharmacy
program
.

the
point
is
--
fhs
gives
you
the
opportunity
to
make
it
to
a
good
college
,
but
you
need
to
work
hard
.

absolutely
the
best
little
motel
on
the
coast
!

i
've
stayed
at
this
fabulous
little
motel
two
years
running
,
and
i
have
to
say
it
's
one
of
the
best
lodging
experiences
i
've
ever
had
on
the
coast
...
and
i
'm
even
comparing
it
to
the
big
resorts
i
've
stayed
at
!

a
large
group
of
my
friends
and
i
rent
almost
the
whole
motel
every
year
for
a
weekend
,
and
the
experience
and
stay
have
always
been
five
-
star
.

the
rooms
are
so
clean
,
the
managers
/
owners
are
the
nicest
people
,
the
place
feels
so
homey
,
and
the
location
and
grounds
are
beautiful
.

there
's
a
restaurant
nearby
(
walking
distance
)
with
a
great
breakfast
,
and
a
market
across
the
street
.

the
motel
is
very
well
maintained
,
and
the
managers
are
so
accomodating
,
it
's
kind
of
like
visiting
family
each
year
!
;-)

i
honestly
ca
n't
rave
enough
about
this
place
...
it
's
really
a
hidden
gem
worth
checking
out
!

my
favorite
cuban
cafe
in
orlando

i
have
been
eating
cuban
for
a
long
time
,
sandwiches
mainly
along
with
other
dishes
..

i
love
cuban
coffee
,
colada
...
mmmm
anyways
i
found
this
place
and
ca
n't
stop
going
there
,
i
stop
in
at
least
once
a
week
and
anytime
i
'm
in
the
area
for
a
cuban
coffee
or
snack
.

the
place
is
chill
and
comfortable
.

they
do
n't
speak
the
best
english
but
enough
to
get
by
.

they
bake
bread
fresh
daily
,
they
do
n't
press
their
sandwiches
which
is
the
way
i
like
it
,
and
the
meat
is
always
fresh
.

they
have
a
great
lunch
special
with
your
choice
of
meat
,
chicken
,
steak
,
or
pork
and
rice
and
black
beans
and
fried
plantains
.

and
their
breakfast
is
awesome
!!

i
can
not
describe
how
delicious
the
mango
and
cheese
pastries
and
the
omelets
are
to
die
for
.

stop
in
and
have
a
bite
you
wo
n't
regret
it
.

a
slice
of
heaven
in
winter
park
off
forsyth
!

highly
recommended
.

i
have
been
going
to
warner
family
for
a
number
of
years
and
would
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
.

i
've
read
some
of
the
reviews
below
and
would
like
to
state
that
yes
,
like
any
other
doctor
s
office
there
is
sometimes
a
wait
(
depending
on
what
other
patients
are
being
seen
for
)
and
some
of
the
tests
and
procedures
that
are
ran
can
be
costly
(
just
like
they
would
be
for
any
other
medical
tests
elsewhere
if
you
do
not
have
insurance
)
...

i
have
seen
several
of
the
providers
from
the
office
and
have
not
once
been
shown
anything
but
care
and
consideration
.

i
ca
nt
speak
for
them
but
any
tests
or
appointments
they
recommend
are
probably
in
the
best
interests
of
us
(
the
patient
)
and
you
have
the
ability
to
decline
anything
that
they
suggest
to
you
.

i
personally
have
had
wonderful
service
and
if
you
re
truely
looking
for
a
family
practice
...
warner
family
is
the
place
for
you
.

not
what
i
expected
!

we
read
the
good
reviews
before
going
and
had
high
hopes
..
but
to
our
dismay
it
did
nt
turn
out
that
way
!

~
it
took
over
40
mins
to
be
taken
to
our
table
,
once
there
it
took
another
20
mins
to
get
our
orders
and
a
further
45
mins
till
our
starters
landed
on
our
table
.

very
frustrating
for
a
restaurant
that
has
1
rosette
and
is
supposedly
renowned
for
the
service
...
hmm
there
was
no
canape's
or
amuse
to
keep
us
occupied
,
once
we
complained
about
the
wait
they
took
us
something
to
nibble
on
but
that
took
us
getting
out
our
chairs
and
wondering
round
to
do
that
and
it
was
impossible
to
get
anyone
s
attention
.

scallops
were
overcooked
and
the
foie
gras
was
cold
but
the
rest
of
the
food
was
lovely
.

on
top
of
that
though
they
tried
to
charge
us
service
charge
just
to
rub
it
it
....

would
n't
go
back
as
there
are
a
lot
of
places
a
lot
better
and
cheaper
.

nice
selection
,
very
clean
,
friendly
staff
!

hot
iron
has
become
a
favorite
of
our
family
.

everyone
can
get
the
signature
dish
with
ingredients
and
spices
that
they
want
and
have
the
fun
of
watching
it
cook
.

the
staff
are
very
friendly
and
conscientious
.

they
always
ask
if
you
have
meat
in
your
dish
,
(
for
vegetarians
like
me
)
,
they
scrub
an
area
of
the
grill
and
use
separate
utensils
to
cook
.

they
do
n't
just
dump
your
ingredients
on
and
cook
either
,
but
carefully
separate
meat
to
the
hotter
parts
of
the
grill
and
still
manage
to
keep
the
veggies
from
turning
to
mush
.

the
selection
of
meats
,
veggies
and
sauces
is
awesome
too
!

every
time
we
go
they
seem
to
have
a
different
ingredient
or
two
which
keeps
things
interesting
.

meats
are
kept
very
cold
,
seafood
smells
fresh
and
the
serving
bar
is
very
clean
.

prices
are
reasonable
,
(
kid
s
meals
are
around
4.99
)
and
wednesday's
they
have
discount
dinner
prices
,
i
believe
.

great
cookies
,
cakes
,
and
customer
service

it
was
my
birthday
and
i
had
a
last
minute
idea
to
have
a
bakery
cake
instead
of
one
pre-made
in
a
convenience
store
,
but
the
problem
was
it
was
the
day
before
valentine
s
and
when
many
bakeries
turned
me
down
for
a
plain
vanilla
rectangle
cake
,
fiona
stepped
up
to
the
plate
and
was
able
to
make
a
fantastic
beautiful
cake
.

not
only
did
it
taste
wonderful
,
but
the
texture
was
unbelievable
,
the
frosting
was
n't
overly
sweet
to
over
power
the
cake
,
and
the
cake
itself
was
just
amazingly
soft
,
and
fluffy
,
and
just
perfect
overall
.

although
i
'll
have
to
drive
a
little
out
of
my
way
to
go
there
,
i
'll
gladly
do
it
knowing
that
since
she
's
been
astounding
to
me
once
before
that
she
'll
always
be
that
way
!

(
also
she
has
a
really
great
website
!

and
we
bought
a
few
cookies
there
too
,
they
were
fantastic
as
well
!
)

she
deserves
many
5
star
reviews
!!

food
craving
gone
and
weight
loss
at
acupuncture
doctor

i
am
a
college
student
.

before
treatment
,
my
food
cravings
were
"
out
of
control
"
which
caused
me
to
be
stressed
out
.

i
experienced
a
definite
decrease
in
food
craving
(
about
50
%
)
and
decrease
in
stress
after
the
1st
treatment
.

i
actually
loss
4
pounds
after
my
1st
treatment
and
2
pounds
after
my
2nd
treatment
.

i
was
amazed
.

i
am
now
more
at
peace
and
my
food
craving
is
about
99
%
gone
after
only
3
treatments
.

before
coming
to
acupuncture
doctor
i
was
a
big
baby
about
needles
and
only
came
because
my
boyfriend
's
aunt
recommended
it
.

it
hurt
very
little
,
felt
more
like
pressure
than
pain
.

what
i
like
most
about
dr.
liau
is
that
she
is
very
caring
.

she
talks
to
you
at
each
appointment
.

i
can
tell
she
really
cares
and
wants
to
help
.

i
am
so
glad
to
have
found
dr.
liau
.

now
i
feel
more
confident
wearing
my
bathing
suit
in
the
summer
.

an
asset
to
richmond

for
a
long
time
,
one
big
source
of
entertainment
missing
from
the
richmond
city
limits
was
a
first
-
run
multiplex
.

bowtie
has
filled
that
role
nicely
.

the
theatre
is
in
an
old
brick
warehouse
,
which
is
a
block
away
from
the
flying
squirrels
stadium
.

the
owners
of
bowtie
manged
to
add
something
new
while
preserving
what
was
already
there
.

the
theatre
has
greatly
improved
the
surrounding
neighborhood
.

there
's
plenty
of
parking
,
and
i
've
never
had
an
issue
with
audience
members
who
wo
n't
stop
talking
or
answering
their
cellphones
.

best
of
all
,
there
are
no
ads
!!!!
!

just
previews
and
the
main
feature
.

expect
to
pay
full
price
,
and
the
theatres
themselves
are
on
the
small
side
.

but
if
you
like
going
to
the
movies
,
you
should
love
bowtie
.

the
mangers
also
play
a
classic
movies
on
sundays
,
you
can
get
a
beer
in
the
lobby
,
and
repeat
customers
can
get
discounts
if
they
have
a
member
card
.

a
great
cinema
in
a
great
location
.

thank
you
,
bowtie
!

craft
wonderland
with
history

my
first
visit
was
so
fun
yesterday
.

i
could
have
stayed
all
day
and
not
seen
all
the
things
.

i
am
doing
origami
jewelry
and
found
exactly
the
right
things
for
earrings
and
got
many
other
ideas
there
too
.

i
bought
a
beginner
s
quilling
set
and
like
making
the
filigree
forms
you
can
make
and
add
to
other
crafts
.

the
owner
,
jean
,
has
been
there
31
years
!

what
a
history
.

she
is
a
super
sweet
,
lovable
and
well
-
informed
woman
with
a
great
sense
of
humor
.

i
really
enjoyed
meeting
her
and
happy
to
learn
she
comes
from
oklahoma
and
has
the
values
of
a
solid
no
bs
country
girl
.

this
store
is
a
real
gem
and
has
much
to
offer
the
serious
crafter
or
the
occasional
crafter
.

by
the
way
,
salmagundi
(
the
store
name
)
means
something
like
smorgasbord
;
potpourri
;
motley
;
variety
;
mixed
bag
;
miscellaneous
assortment
;
mixture
,
a
variety
of
many
kinds
of
things
.

great
name
for
a
great
store

the
2010
genesis
is
grrrrrrrreeeaaat
!

i
am
a
proud
owner
of
a
brand
new
2010
hyundai
genesis
.

i
have
never
seen
this
car
before
until
this
lady
at
wal
mart
had
it
and
she
told
me
she
got
it
here
and
that
everyone
was
so
nice
to
her
.

i
asked
her
who
she
worked
with
and
she
just
told
me
ti
was
the
sales
manager
.

i
took
the
weekend
off
and
came
in
and
asked
for
the
manager
who
is
jeff
and
he
remembered
her
right
away
even
remembered
her
dog
,
i
was
a
bit
shocked
that
someone
would
pay
that
close
attention
.

we
got
to
talking
and
he
got
me
set
up
and
i
test
drove
with
craig
and
i
fell
head
over
heels
for
this
car
all
i
kept
saying
,
"
was
i
got
ta
have
it
!
"

i
thouhgt
it
would
be
out
of
my
price
range
but
they
really
worked
with
me
and
now
i
could
nt
be
happier
.

jeff
and
craig
are
really
good
at
what
they
do
and
know
exactly
how
to
treat
a
customer
.

definitely
go
see
them
!

bait
and
switch
,
untrained
workers

called
the
bonanza
store
2
weeks
ago
,
before
i
ripped
out
350
sq
ft
of
ceramic
tile
...
was
told
i
would
need
a
"
dual
head
concrete
grinder
"
to
remove
thinset
and
make
a
nice
"
finished
"
look
(
ready
for
concrete
stain
)
.

was
quoted
$
55
all
inclusive
of
grinder
inserts
,
etc
.

no
problem
,
sounded
like
it
's
done
every
day
.

will
look
beautiful
.

got
the
tile
ripped
out
,
call
today
,
now
all
the
sudden
this
grinder
wo
n't
leave
a
finished
look
and
it
's
$
125
plus
around
$
75
for
the
inserts
.

i
can
rent
another
machine
for
like
$
60
that
will
give
it
a
finished
look
.

so
from
$
55
to
$
260
?

are
they
serious
?

i
feel
like
they
did
n't
tell
me
the
pitfalls
before
i
pulled
out
this
tile
and
now
that
i
have
no
other
options
they
want
5
times
the
price
?

either
these
people
do
n't
know
anything
about
what
they
are
renting
,
or
worse
-
they
are
bait
and
switching
.

one
suspects
that
earlier
reviewer
works
for
another
laundry
.

outside
of
parking
being
at
a
premium
,
especially
on
discount
days
,
the
laundry
tub
is
not
filthy
and
it
's
no
smaller
than
any
of
a
dozen
laundromats
i
've
been
in
.

yes
,
there
are
bigger
,
but
bigger
is
n't
necessarily
better
.

i
availed
myself
of
the
wash
'n
fold
service
,
taking
just
about
a
year
's
worth
of
dirty
clothes
in
and
getting
back
neatly
folded
,
clean
clothes
in
clear
plastic
bags
(
i
'd
originally
brought
them
in
,
in
six
large
yellow
garbage
bags
)
.

the
cost
was
certainly
reasonable
and
i
will
continue
my
patronage
of
the
laundry
tub
in
the
future
.

did
n't
hurt
any
that
they
knew
my
name
by
my
second
visit
and
greeted
me
warmly
then
and
on
my
third
visit
.

whereas
my
answer
to
the
question
"
where
do
you
get
your
laundry
done
?
"
used
to
be
,
"
at
the
checkout
line
at
walmart
,
"
i
can
honestly
say
the
answer
now
is
,
"
at
the
laundry
tub
.
"

thank
you
!

i
recently
took
a
rescue
puppy
to
this
clinic
and
i
was
shocked
at
how
well
romeo
and
my
family
was
treated
.

they
worked
around
the
clock
to
ensure
that
my
puppy
life
was
saved
.

we
have
to
leave
him
at
the
vet
for
3
days
and
i
was
told
to
call
for
check
ups
as
often
as
i
wished
that
no
matter
how
many
times
i
called
i
would
not
annoy
them
.

lol
they
where
super
friendly
towards
us
and
treated
us
like
people
not
walking
bags
of
cash
.

in
this
day
it
s
rare
to
find
such
wonderful
people
who
care
,
not
the
kind
of
want
to
make
cash
.

i
would
strongly
suggest
you
give
them
the
chance
to
prove
to
you
that
not
all
people
in
this
world
are
evil
!

i
will
never
go
to
another
vet
as
long
as
i
have
animals
.

i
live
nearly
two
hours
away
and
yet
i
will
still
make
the
drive
to
see
them
!

in
fact
i
look
forward
to
taking
my
animals
to
the
vet
simply
because
of
how
my
animals
and
i
are
treated
.

okay
,
here
's
the
scoop
.

i
'm
a
regular
at
the
hh
.

the
food
is
excellent
,
the
serivce
is
horrible
.

i
think
they
're
still
in
the
mindset
from
when
it
was
only
smokers
sitting
around
and
drinking
...
not
in
any
hurry
.

in
my
experience
the
food
has
been
excellent
(
for
the
most
part
)
.

however
,
the
bartenders
/
waitresses
definately
need
to
be
re-trained
(
if
they
ever
had
any
to
begin
with
)
and
learn
two
things
:
only
chat
with
customers
when
other
customers
are
not
impatiently
waiting
and
to
look
around
more
often
to
see
if
people
are
waiting
.

in
some
cases
the
result
is
because
of
understaffing
,
in
some
cases
the
staff
just
does
n't
care
/
know
better
.

they
must
also
get
something
to
keep
take
-
out
warm
,
so
it
's
not
room
temperature
at
best
when
you
get
it
home
.

you
just
have
to
know
what
you
're
getting
into
when
you
go
.

nice
local
pub
,
excellent
food
(
especially
wings
)
,
and
do
n't
go
if
you
have
a
limited
amount
of
time
.

trust
the
midas
touch

i
personally
trust
this
midas
store
with
all
my
vehicles
,
i
have
been
going
there
for
years
&
would
never
go
anywhere
else
!

the
staff
is
very
personable
&
actually
care
about
the
customers
safety
rather
than
taking
there
money
.

this
is
however
a
very
busy
shop
but
there
are
appointments
available
&
the
staff
up
front
will
surely
make
sure
you
get
back
in
a
timely
manner
.

i
look
at
some
of
these
other
comments
&
laugh
because
people
think
that
the
world
revolves
around
them
!

like
the
girl
with
the
fuse
problem
...

midas
has
the
most
high
tech
equipment
in
town
&
i
guarantee
you
if
they
told
you
it
was
electrical
then
in
deed
it
s
electrical
!

maybe
you
should
understand
how
the
world
works
&
realize
you
are
just
like
any
other
person
&
not
put
yourself
on
a
pedestal
.

i
will
continue
going
to
dave
at
midas
because
he
is
one
of
the
most
honest
business
owners
in
this
town
!

when
having
your
car
worked
on
you
have
to
trust
the
mechanic
&
this
midas
is
truly
someone
you
can
trust
!

we
decided
to
try
this
place
last
night
because
we
noticed
that
it
had
some
interesting
things
on
the
menu
aside
from
the
usual
rolls
--
live
scallop
sashimi
,
duck
breast
nigiri
with
foie
gras
,
panko
mussels
--
but
none
of
these
were
particularly
great
or
worth
the
sticker
price
.

additionally
we
tried
the
logan
circle
roll
,
spicy
crab
and
tuna
roll
,
and
sweet
potato
tempura
roll
(
$
15
,
$
10
,
and
$
3.75
respectively
)
.

the
sweet
potato
tempura
roll
was
actually
a
great
surprise
:
cheap
and
delicious
,
the
only
thing
we
tried
that
i
would
say
was
well
worth
it
and
a
great
value
(
and
i
never
get
vegetarian
rolls
)
.

the
other
rolls
were
n't
at
all
special
,
especially
given
their
pricing
.

the
bottom
line
is
that
the
food
is
n't
great
and
is
relatively
high
-
priced
.

the
service
is
solicitous
,
the
atmosphere
is
nice
and
mod
except
the
out
-
of
-
place
flat
-
screen
tv
playing
football
.

but
i
'd
go
elsewhere
unless
the
prices
are
cut
.

it
's
just
not
worth
it
.

do
n't
expect
sleep
or
courtesy

i
was
booked
for
2
nights
at
this
hotel
in
oct
2007
.

at
3:15
am
on
night
2
,
the
fire
alarm
and
strobe
light
activated
in
my
room
.

these
are
not
household
type
alarms
.

when
they
sound
off
,
it
is
a
true
audio
/
visual
experience
.

i
called
the
front
desk
and
got
no
answer
.

after
checking
for
signs
of
fire
or
smoke
and
seeing
none
,
i
decided
to
just
pack
up
and
leave
.

the
desk
agent
actually
argued
with
me
,
claiming
that
no
such
alarm
had
gone
off
(
as
if
i
would
make
that
up
?
)
.

he
finally
admitted
that
only
the
4
ada
room
alarms
had
sounded
,
so
only
4
guests
were
effected
(
no
big
deal
to
him
)
.

this
little
drip
offered
no
apologies
whatsoever
,
and
even
refused
to
give
me
the
name
of
the
manager
until
i
pressed
him
for
it
3
times
.

this
hotel
is
adequate
enough
,
but
there
is
an
obvious
problem
with
the
staff
and
management
.

do
not
go
there
if
you
expect
to
sleep
through
the
night
.

poor
service
,
lack
of
passion
:
do
not
go

i
began
seeing
dr.
romanick
back
in
2000
and
have
seen
a
significant
decline
in
the
quality
of
care
,
patient
-
doctor
communication
,
and
just
the
overall
level
of
services
.

the
poor
quality
starts
at
the
receptionist
desk
,
where
the
staff
is
very
impatient
and
lack
the
efficiency
i
once
loved
about
the
office
.

it
took
them
nearly
two
months
to
complete
a
simple
task
,
and
countless
calls
from
my
part
due
to
their
lack
of
response
and
passion
(
not
that
it
's
a
requirement
for
the
job
,
but
it
helps
to
at
least
pretend
to
be
helpful
)
.

also
,
i
was
promised
to
have
my
test
results
emailed
to
me
,
but
it
never
happened
,
and
after
a
few
attempts
to
get
dr.
romanick
on
the
phone
to
brief
me
on
my
condition
,
i
finally
gave
up
and
went
to
a
different
doctor
.

please
do
not
go
there
if
it
's
professional
,
friendly
,
diligent
medical
services
you
're
looking
for
.

save
yourself
the
trouble
,
money
and
time
and
visit
a
more
caring
facility
/
doctor
.

the
moving
company
is
actualy
based
in
brooklyn
,
but
advertised
all
over
ny
/
nj
,
including
fort
lee
.

when
the
guys
arrived
(
2
hours
later
than
agreed
)
they
told
that
you
have
to
pay
all
the
tolls
they
payed
coming
from
brooklyn
and
extra
$
100
for
them
to
drive
back
from
your
destination
.

that
was
not
in
agreement
eather
,
but
they
realy
demand
it
.

and
another
$
100
for
wrapping
the
furniture
.

so
totalling
$
212
just
for
start
before
any
work
started
.

guess
what
,
was
not
in
the
initial
agreement
as
well
.

i
was
moving
out
from
2
bdr
apartment
and
it
took
for
3
strong
guys
6
hours
to
load
a
track
(
from
2
pm
-
8
pm
)
.

the
only
reason
i
'm
giving
3
stars
instead
of
1
or
2
,
i
should
admit
,
nothing
was
broken
.

so
i
still
can
recomend
them
but
prepare
pay
twice
as
much
as
they
tell
you
initially
.

one
more
thing
,
they
do
n't
take
any
credit
cards
or
checks
.

you
have
to
pay
cash
only
before
they
start
unloading
track
on
your
destination
.

worst
apartments
ever

we
lived
here
for
2
years
,
the
first
year
or
so
was
okay
.

then
,
the
more
power
they
gave
to
linda
,
the
worse
the
place
got
.

we
were
always
having
our
water
shut
off
,
there
were
always
people
having
parties
at
the
pool
,
even
after
it
was
supposed
to
be
closed
.

the
pool
was
supposed
to
close
at
10
and
they
would
have
people
down
there
until
11:45
yelling
,
playing
music
and
do
who
-
knows
-
what
in
the
dark
corners
of
the
pool
.

then
,
when
we
moved
out
,
we
cleaned
the
apartment
top
to
bottom
,
they
came
back
and
tried
to
charge
us
for
two
cleaning
fees
(
and
we
never
got
our
deposit
back
)
and
past
utilities
(
that
were
already
paid
,
we
have
check
numbers
and
records
of
this
)
.

linda
is
the
rudest
person
you
will
ever
talk
to
and
she
sticks
up
for
all
of
the
trashy
,
rude
people
that
live
there
,
not
the
nice
ones
that
actually
give
a
crap
about
respecting
others
.

do
not
live
here
,
you
will
regret
it
!

the
worst
experience
ever
!!!

i
have
worked
with
ted
jurek
at
decor
and
you
,
and
it
started
out
as
a
decent
experience
.

he
was
referred
to
me
by
a
friend
,
who
did
n't
have
the
best
experience
with
ted
,
but
said
that
ted
was
able
to
make
up
for
his
lack
of
preparedness
at
the
end
.

i
figure
i
would
give
this
company
a
chance
.

however
,
after
giving
a
required
$
500.00
(
non
refundable
)
deposit
before
seeing
any
plans
or
ideas
,
i
was
sorry
i
did
.

we
met
a
couple
of
weeks
later
,
ted
was
late
.

he
brought
fabric
books
,
and
pictures
of
furniture
only
,
which
all
came
way
over
budget
.

by
the
time
we
got
to
the
budget
i
told
him
i
could
work
with
,
there
was
basically
no
design
.

just
curtains
and
a
couple
of
accessories
.

what
is
that
?????

this
company
is
way
too
expensive
with
nothing
to
show
for
it
.

please
everyone
....
take
heed
and
do
n't
get
caught
up
in
the
hype
about
decor
and
you
working
with
every
budget
...

this
is
just
a
way
for
them
to
squirm
their
way
into
your
precious
pocket

horrible
.

horrible
.

when
we
walked
in
,
the
person
behind
desk
said
:
"
oh
well
,
you
must
wait
,
i
am
in
the
middle
of
something
.
"

after
a
good
few
minutes
,
he
asked
:
"
what
do
you
want
?
"

somewhere
in
between
his
rudeness
he
asked
if
we
smoked
.

i
asked
if
this
hotel
had
smoking
rooms
.

he
immediately
said
"
no
,
there
is
a
$
50
deposit
now
!
"

sure
enough
he
charged
it
to
the
credit
card
.

when
i
inquired
he
rudely
replied
"
in
the
morning
when
things
are
checked
out
you
'll
get
it
back
.
"

i
called
customer
service
about
it
because
the
website
specifically
states
that
there
are
no
other
charges
at
the
check
-
in
.

i
also
mentioned
to
the
reception
person
.

he
responded
"
we
have
problem
with
'
people
'
"
.

imagine
a
hotel
having
problems
with
people
.

i
finally
alerted
him
to
his
rudeness
.

he
said
he
's
had
a
long
and
bad
day
.

we
had
no
choice
but
to
stay
but
will
take
this
as
far
as
we
can
.

do
n't
stay
there
.

i
came
to
find
out
the
person
was
the
hotel
owner
also
.

my
friend
and
i
were
to
stay
here
for
a
girls
night
,
catch
up
on
our
lives
evening
.

we
live
within
20
miles
of
the
hotel
and
wanted
to
get
away
from
our
responsibilities
for
the
night
.

unfortunalty
my
husband
and
i
had
to
put
our
13
year
old
lab
down
that
morning
and
we
were
not
expecting
this
.

my
friend
called
the
hotel
to
cancel
our
room
as
soon
as
i
called
her
.

they
said
that
we
were
to
be
charged
for
this
room
regardless
because
we
did
not
cancel
within
the
72
hours
.

i
called
them
back
a
few
hours
after
putting
my
bodhi
down
and
they
still
would
n't
budge
.

times
are
hard
,
i
know
,
but
they
had
no
compassion
.

i
called
3
times
to
talked
to
a
manager
,
never
a
call
back
.

i
emailed
4
times
,
never
a
response
.

in
one
of
the
emails
i
attached
the
letter
from
the
vet
's
that
expressed
their
sympathy
,
this
hotel
did
nothing
.

i
even
emailed
mackinaw
tourist
and
nothing
.

i
am
sure
this
is
a
good
place
to
stay
from
reading
the
other
reviews
,
but
if
something
unexpected
happens
in
your
life
,
they
will
not
care
.

fanfuckingtastic

ok
i
am
a
new
yorker
who
has
been
going
to
school
in
oxford
,
england
.

i
thought
the
uk
was
completely
devoid
of
good
nyc
style
pizza
.

i
thought
to
get
a
decent
pizza
the
only
way
was
at
a
fancy
restaurant
,
and
i
have
to
get
a
whole
pie
.

i
thought
i
would
have
to
wait
until
i
went
home
to
nyc
.

well
then
i
went
on
a
trip
to
glasgow
and
was
walking
around
.

i
saw
this
place
and
it
looked
like
the
holy
grail
.

i
knew
i
had
found
the
real
deal
,
big
pies
,
sold
by
the
slice
,
with
the
pizzas
sitting
under
the
glass
in
the
front
.

they
have
crushed
red
pepper
flakes
and
oregano
.

so
i
ordered
a
slice
.

it
tasted
like
i
just
flew
back
home
.

i
du
n
no
how
they
did
it
,
but
scottish
friends
---
this
is
the
real
deal
.

i
congratulated
this
establishment
for
doing
the
research
on
making
nyc
pizza
because
these
scots
fcking
nailed
it
.

that
being
said
,
i
do
n't
know
how
their
delivery
service
is
.

they
might
want
to
change
the
name
to
reflect
the
new
yorkedness
of
the
pizza
,
scrummy
yummy
sounds
gimmicky
to
me
.

good
food
,
good
wait
staff
,
poor
management

we
visited
on
7/26/08
for
dinner
we
received
a
gift
certificate
for
the
mama
mia
's
on
greenfield
ave
.

the
food
was
good
,
and
so
was
our
waitress
.

when
it
came
time
to
pay
the
bill
up
front
,
they
would
not
let
me
use
any
of
the
certificate
for
a
tip
(
which
i
have
done
with
any
other
restaurant
i
've
gotten
a
gift
certificate
for
.
)

i
then
asked
if
i
could
have
money
back
in
cash
.

the
person
went
to
go
check
with
the
manager
,
who
was
sitting
at
a
table
chatting
with
her
friends
who
were
eating
there
.

her
answer
was
short
and
manner
rather
rude
.

sorry
for
interrupting
i
guess
.

the
cashier
was
also
short
,
unapologetic
and
made
me
feel
as
i
was
wasting
her
time
.

there
were
no
other
options
available
(
i
only
brought
my
check
card
to
cover
any
overage
cost
)
and
she
rang
it
up
and
applied
it
to
the
gift
card
before
telling
me
about
the
tip
policy
.

i
will
not
be
visiting
mama
mia
's
again
.

there
are
other
places
with
food
just
as
good
with
management
that
values
customers
and
employees
much
more
.

dining
at
texas
roadhouse

texas
roadhouse
has
very
good
meals
,
that
the
meat
comes
right
off
the
bones
.

it
has
very
good
prices
.

on
a
bad
note
the
waiting
area
is
not
enjoyable
or
enough
seats
.

also
,
there
should
not
be
peanuts
all
over
the
floor
.

next
,
there
should
only
be
one
person
bringing
you
your
food
.

it
s
not
a
big
deal
but
i
had
to
take
my
salad
home
because
they
forgot
to
bring
it
.

i
had
to
ask
the
girl
who
brought
my
food
and
she
never
came
back
to
let
me
know
.

i
had
to
wait
for
my
waitress
.

when
you
first
come
in
the
hostess
is
not
very
friendly
,
there
is
just
a
bunch
of
workers
standing
there
.

i
was
there
on
march
6th
,
2009
.

i
was
also
there
of
july
4th
2008
,
when
my
daughter
s
buffalo
wings
came
out
with
a
fly
on
it
.

the
manager
came
over
and
said
he
was
sorry
and
gave
a
new
batch
of
wings
,
he
said
we
ca
nt
really
do
anything
because
the
doors
are
always
opening
and
closing
.

in
my
opinion
should
of
just
took
off
the
price
of
the
wings
from
the
bill
.

but
everyone
has
there
own
way
!!!!!!

mezza
luna
ftw
!

their
mezza
luna's
are
deffly
better
than
the
pizza
rolls
.

it
s
like
a
pizza
roll
,
but
they
just
toss
ham
and
cheese
inside
.

it
seems
like
it
s
healthier
too
,
but
it
s
prolly
not
.

also
,
you
can
call
em
ahead
of
time
,
and
then
go
to
pick
up
ur
food
,
or
have
it
delivered
**
.

that
cuts
down
on
teh
wait
time
,
cus
u
can
do
other
stuff
while
u
r
waiting
.

it
usually
takes
20
mins
for
a
mezza
luna
,
as
they
have
to
add
pure
delicious
extract
to
the
mix
.

their
pizza
was
a
little
salty
for
me
,
but
it
s
still
good
.

they
do
that
whole
thing
where
you
sandwich
the
pepperoni
between
layers
of
cheese
for
+
32
delicious
.

anyways
,
the
mezza
luna
:
you
should
try
it
.

it
runs
you
about
4
bucks
and
it
deals
crushing
blows
to
hunger
.

**
edit
:
living
on
campus
at
clarkson
university
,
i
have
had
food
delivered
before
.

this
was
back
between
'05
and
'09
and
i
do
n't
remember
how
many
times
we
've
had
it
delivered
.

perhaps
they
do
n't
deliver
anymore
,
but
the
deliciousness
of
a
mezza
luna
certainly
warrants
a
pickup
.

my
2004
x
-
type
was
getting
close
to
100,000
miles
so
it
was
time
for
an
upgrade
.

i
sent
my
wife
and
daughter
over
to
check
out
a
pre-owned
2009
xf
.

michael
chestney
was
very
pleasant
and
patient
with
my
wife
and
she
suggested
i
go
check
it
out
.

i
went
in
later
that
afternoon
and
met
with
michael
.

he
showed
me
the
car
i
was
interested
in
and
we
took
a
test
drive
.

i
loved
the
car
so
we
began
negotiating
my
trade
-
in
and
the
price
of
the
09
xf
.

the
entire
negotiation
took
about
20
minutes
.

fair
give
and
take
on
both
sides
until
we
agreed
on
a
deal
that
was
within
my
parameters
and
was
fair
to
both
sides
.

10
minutes
of
paperwork
and
i
was
the
owner
of
a
beautiful
pre-owned
09
xf
.

i
have
purchased
over
15
vehicles
(
cars
,
rvs
,
and
boats
)
in
my
lifetime
and
i
have
to
say
the
experience
with
michael
and
barrett
motor
cars
of
san
antonio
was
one
of
the
best
.

friendly
,
knowledgeable
,
and
above
all
fair
.

that
's
all
you
can
really
ask
from
a
car
dealer
and
michael
and
barrett
hit
all
3
.

thanks
for
the
great
deal
and
the
great
car
!

identity
theft

myself
and
my
fiance
's
identity
was
stolen
from
the
office
staff
.

we
were
told
by
a
detective
and
asked
to
check
our
credit
for
anything
unusual
.

luckily
they
caught
the
crooks
before
they
did
one
on
us
.

it
was
a
black
female
that
use
to
work
in
the
office
.

she
stole
the
information
and
gave
it
to
another
guy
that
did
all
the
work
.

the
other
guy
was
pulled
over
one
day
and
a
cop
saw
suspicious
papers
with
names
and
social
security
numbers
on
it
.

that
s
how
they
were
caught
.

they
both
went
to
jail
and
a
new
manager
was
put
in
charge
of
the
apartments
.

the
apartment
across
from
mine
belonged
to
a
gang
of
hookers
.

nobody
lived
there
.

a
girl
would
show
up
,
then
a
guy
in
a
nice
car
would
show
up
.

short
time
later
the
guy
would
leave
,
then
the
girl
.

my
apartment
was
usually
quiet
.

i
lived
in
one
that
did
not
face
the
parking
lot
.

parking
spaces
are
just
big
enough
for
a
mini
cooper
.

it
sucked
having
an
suv
.

if
i
found
a
spot
,
i
could
nt
fit
in
it
.

gates
worked
30
%
of
the
time
at
best
.

bugs
were
a
small
problem
,
nothing
too
bad
.

the
best
there
is
in
service
.

i
was
recently
traveling
down
i
-
24
from
nashville
with
my
3
young
children
and
had
a
blowout
on
the
southeast
side
of
murfreesboro
.

it
was
4:50
when
a
friend
told
me
to
call
bud
,
he
would
take
care
of
me
.

not
only
did
they
answer
the
phone
at
4:50
on
a
thursday
,
they
hit
the
ground
moving
!.

they
tracked
down
the
only
tire
that
fit
my
bmw
330i
in
murfreesboro
within
minutes
and
secured
it
,
then
they
came
out
,
took
off
my
tire
(
it
was
a
runflat
-
but
runflats
do
n't
do
you
any
good
if
they
blow
out
)
,
and
brought
it
to
their
shop
to
change
the
tire
.

they
were
back
quickly
considering
how
far
outside
of
murfreesboro
we
were
and
had
us
on
our
way
by
6:30
that
evening
.

thanks
bud
for
all
of
your
help
and
taking
time
away
from
your
family
that
evening
.

it
's
without
a
doubt
,
the
best
service
experience
i
've
ever
had
and
just
to
be
clear
,
the
price
he
charged
me
was
the
same
as
my
tire
guy
in
nashville
's
price
for
putting
on
the
other
rear
tire
.

i
hope
i
can
return
the
favor
in
the
future
!

service
and
client
base
not
ok
.

i
have
stayed
in
this
hotel
many
times
,
and
while
it
typically
offers
a
decent
bang
for
the
buck
,
its
client
base
largely
consists
of
troubled
youngsteers
and
evictees
from
the
local
,
not
so
pleasant
hood
.

i
have
never
considered
this
a
real
problem
as
i
travel
without
kids
and
can
fend
for
myself
,
but
when
i
had
to
listen
to
a
(
non-violent
)
domestic
fight
that
lasted
from
1
am
to
5
am
during
my
last
stay
and
i
found
out
that
the
front
desk
was
unmanned
during
night
hours
,
my
choice
was
to
either
waste
tax
payers
money
by
calling
for
a
yet
another
police
dispatch
to
this
hotel
,
or
just
get
over
it
.

i
chose
the
later
,
but
approached
the
front
desk
about
the
hotel
policy
to
push
over
their
responsibilities
on
local
authorities
,
not
to
mention
the
good
night
s
sleep
i
paid
for
but
did
nt
get
.

i
was
told
management
would
call
me
back
but
still
waiting
for
that
call
.

i
will
probably
stay
here
again
because
it
s
cheap
and
i
ca
nt
afford
a
better
hotel
,
but
do
not
look
forward
to
it
and
would
definitely
not
recommend
this
hotel
for
families
or
single
female
travellers
.

was
there
this
past
weekend
and
the
guy
behind
the
counter
yelled
at
me
and
my
son
because
we
believed
he
left
the
grandma
slice
in
the
oven
a
little
too
long
and
the
cheese
got
all
dried
out
and
the
slice
tasted
more
like
a
cracker
.

he
preceded
to
grab
the
slice
off
the
countertop
and
throw
it
into
the
trash
while
yelling
at
me
saying
,
"
you
do
not
order
what
you
do
not
know
about
"
and
"
you
do
n't
know
how
pizza
is
made
"
.

it
was
very
upsetting
to
see
this
kind
of
behavior
especially
in
front
of
my
four
year
old
.

he
was
in
the
process
of
making
me
a
pie
and
when
i
got
home
,
the
pie
was
the
worst
i
have
ever
seen
.

cheese
was
falling
off
,
so
oily
and
greasy
.

i
think
he
did
it
on
purpose
because
of
my
simple
request
for
another
slice
of
grandma
that
was
n't
so
well
-
done
(
actually
,
burnt
)
.

i
will
never
go
back
to
this
place
and
i
am
reporting
them
to
the
better
business
bureau
for
such
horrible
customer
relations
and
basically
sabotaging
my
pizza
and
taking
my
$
25
.

this
story
is
100
%
true
.

that
little
man
who
thinks
he
invented
pizza
can
kiss
my
*ss
.

long
lines
,
silly
rules
,
rude
staff
,
ok
food

the
first
thing
you
notice
when
you
arrive
on
location
is
that
the
waiting
line
literally
goes
out
the
door
and
spills
into
the
parking
lot
.

a
restaurant
with
this
many
patrons
willing
to
stand
in
line
just
to
order
tacos
must
be
good
,
right
?

i
mean
,
that
's
the
way
it
works
at
amusement
parks
:
the
longest
lines
are
at
the
best
rides
.

well
,
this
may
be
an
exception
.

the
staff
taking
your
order
and
"
waiting
"
on
you
are
very
indifferent
and
have
no
sense
of
costumer
service
at
all
.

i
have
gotten
better
results
talking
to
comcast
customer
service
than
with
these
folks
.

and
do
n't
even
think
about
asking
to
speak
to
the
manager
because
this
guy
is
,
and
pardon
my
french
,
a
jerk
.

if
you
have
gotten
through
ordering
,
dealing
with
the
rude
staff
and
if
you
followed
the
dumb
rules
,
you
are
finally
presented
with
what
you
came
for
..
some
tacos
that
are
"
ok
,
"
but
definitely
not
worth
putting
up
with
all
the
hassle
.

save
yourself
the
trouble
and
skip
this
place
all
together
.

i
suggest
you
go
up
to
raging
taco
&
raging
burrito
a
couple
of
blocks
up
the
street
or
even
taco
mac
.

wish
this
was
in
saratoga
--

we
were
introduced
to
bistro
tallulah
by
traveler
-
professional
diner
who
happens
to
own
the
adelphi
hotel
and
travels
the
world
--
and
residing
in
paris
,
london
,
new
york
the
rest
of
the
year
.

she
knows
great
food
and
dining
experiences
.

she
was
dead
on
--
this
restaurant
was
wonderful
---
do
not
be
put
off
by
the
one
negative
review
on
this
page
.

i
can
tell
you
we
were
pleasantly
surprised
--
bt
has
taste
memory
and
each
time
back
the
food
was
consistently
delicious
--
same
dishes
--
were
consistent
.

our
friend
is
a
world
traveler
and
loves
unpretentious
dining
experiences
and
inspired
food
.

this
chef
knows
what
he
is
doing
.

treat
yourself
and
go
--
you
will
go
back
!

i
am
a
business
owner
in
downtown
saratoga
springs
and
wish
this
restaurant
was
in
our
town
!

the
affordable
rent
makes
it
possible
for
an
inspired
chef
to
serve
his
high
quality
fare
at
affordable
prices
!

unlike
saratoga
.

i
rrly
seek
the
cehf
out
to
introduce
myself
--
but
the
second
time
we
went
--
i
made
a
point
of
asking
our
wait
person
to
introduce
my
friend
and
myself
to
the
chef
to
tell
him
just
how
good
our
meals
were
.

can
not
wait
to
go
gain
.

i
think
that
the
re
pretty
good
.

first
of
all
,
if
you
call
for
an
appointment
they
wo
n't
tell
you
to
call
back
a
month
later
so
you
can
then
make
one
.

they
also
do
n't
tell
you
that
they
're
going
to
mail
you
an
"
application
"
to
be
admitted
to
be
a
patient
.

i
feel
that
the
way
some
doctor
s
offices
work
around
here
is
a
little
bit
absurd
so
i
'm
happy
that
these
guys
do
n't
do
those
two
things
in
particlular
.

usually
you
can
be
seen
the
same
week
or
maybe
the
following
week
.

the
doctor
did
tell
me
that
my
male
pattern
baldness
is
due
to
my
mother
s
father
because
the
gene
is
exclusively
passed
on
through
maternal
line
but
that
's
a
common
misconception
(
http://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-living/beauty-personal-care/hair-loss-10-08/hair-loss.htm
)
.

in
general
i
would
say
that
the
staff
is
attentive
and
nice
.

but
then
again
i
was
nice
to
them
so
that
could
have
been
why
.

anyhow
,
after
reading
some
of
the
other
reviews
it
seems
like
some
of
the
other
reviewers
are
expecting
mircles
.

if
you
want
miracles
you
'll
have
to
go
to
21st
st
.

it
's
a
pretty
typical
primary
care
office
but
for
the
area
it
's
very
good
.

they
do
n't
do
certain
things
that
are
really
annoying
about
other
offices
.

first
trip
to
canada

i
recently
traveled
to
canada
on
business
and
had
a
most
excellent
experience
.

i
work
for
a
large
retail
company
recently
expanding
our
operations
into
canada
and
had
to
travel
to
ensure
all
of
our
computer
network
equipment
was
installed
properly
and
on
time
.

this
can
tend
to
be
a
stressful
experience
in
itself
let
alone
adding
crossing
boarders
for
the
first
time
.

i
was
very
pleased
to
find
my
accommodations
and
the
hotel
staff
to
be
a
very
calming
and
comforting
part
of
my
trip
.

i
found
the
hotel
to
be
amazingly
clean
,
not
to
mention
very
well
adorned
with
many
pleasant
surprises
.

from
my
first
encounter
at
check
in
to
my
regrettable
check
out
i
found
the
staff
and
facility
to
exceed
my
expectation
.

i
completely
enjoyed
my
whole
check
in
experience
and
was
impressed
with
the
friendliness
and
professionalism
of
the
staff
as
well
as
the
accommodations
themselves
.

i
will
be
traveling
in
this
area
in
the
future
and
you
can
be
assured
that
this
experience
will
be
helpful
in
my
choice
of
hotels
and
novotel
will
be
my
first
selection
.

yes
the
parking
can
be
a
challenge
but
being
from
nj
i
am
no
stranger
to
tight
corners
.

please
pass
my
appreciation
to
the
staff
and
management
for
their
excellent
hospitality
and
good
spirits
as
it
helped
make
a
stressful
trip
enjoyable
.

favorite
place
in
tampa

update
:
i
had
to
add
to
my
review
.

i
was
just
in
last
night
and
had
a
chance
to
dine
in
their
new
dining
room
.

amazing
!

i
frequent
this
resturant
on
a
weekly
basis
but
usally
only
for
lunch
.

well
i
was
in
for
a
treat
when
i
was
greeted
by
the
friendly
girls
at
the
counter
who
asked
if
my
wife
and
i
would
like
to
sit
in
their
"
new
"
dining
room
.

right
away
they
told
us
that
it
was
the
same
great
food
with
the
same
prices
so
off
we
went
.

we
were
greeted
again
and
sat
promptly
.

after
looking
at
the
menu
and
seeing
the
new
menu
items
they
had
,
we
knew
we
were
in
for
a
treat
!

i
had
the
chicken
parmesan
dinner
and
my
wife
had
the
shrimp
scampi
dinner
.

amazing
!

the
portions
were
generous
enough
that
we
even
took
some
home
!

i
have
to
say
the
value
of
this
place
always
amazes
me
.

it
's
nice
to
see
that
even
in
the
economy
we
can
eat
a
place
that
has
upscale
service
,
amazing
atmosphere
,
and
incredible
food
,
but
not
break
the
bank
while
enjoying
it
!

bottom
line
is
that
when
it
's
a
small
privatly
owned
resturant
like
this
is
you
can
tell
that
the
owners
and
employees
take
pride
in
their
product
and
service
.

well
done
!

great
work
and
honest
establishment
!

i
typically
have
work
done
on
my
jeep
at
the
dealership
,
but
it
is
6
years
old
now
and
getting
charged
dealership
prices
just
did
n't
seem
cost
effective
anymore
.

i
had
tried
out
few
place
around
the
area
and
had
been
ripped
off
a
few
times
.

i
had
hear
great
things
about
phet
and
g&g
automotive
so
i
decided
to
give
him
a
try
.

the
service
was
excellent
and
personable
.

he
checked
out
what
i
needed
to
have
done
told
me
what
needed
be
fixed
before
he
did
any
work
and
did
great
repair
work
.

the
price
was
actually
lower
than
what
i
had
anticipated
and
used
to
compared
to
other
places
,
plus
he
showed
me
the
work
he
did
when
i
came
in
to
pick
up
the
car
.

also
,
a
week
after
the
work
,
phet
called
me
up
to
see
how
my
car
was
running
and
to
let
me
know
that
they
had
accidentally
overcharged
me
for
part
of
the
work
and
wanted
to
give
me
a
refund
for
that
amount
.

that
is
just
unheard
of
these
days
!

i
grew
up
in
a
small
town
where
you
knew
and
trusted
your
mechanic
and
was
really
cynical
about
city
auto
repair
shops
since
i
moved
here
,
but
phet
has
shown
that
there
really
are
honest
hard
working
mechanics
around
.

he
is
my
mechanic
going
forward
!

our
company
is
a
high
end
designer
handbag
and
fashion
accessories
company
,
thus
we
are
certainly
a
niche
market
.

we
had
been
evaluating
seo
providers
for
quite
some
time
and
finally
decided
to
take
the
plunge
with
stuart
,
and
ulistic
.

we
made
the
decision
for
a
couple
of
reasons
.

1
.
social
media
.

we
were
familiar
with
search
engine
optimization
strategies
,
but
new
nothing
about
social
media
-
we
just
heard
that
it
was
the
next
big
thing
.

2
.
we
really
liked
the
fact
that
stuart
sets
defined
objectives
and
we
meet
once
a
month
to
go
over
our
key
performance
indicators
.

how
has
it
gone
so
far
?

well
we
have
been
working
with
ulistic
for
1.5
months
,
and
have
100
people
following
our
site
on
facebook
,
and
our
web
site
,
www.designofashion.com
has
seen
a
3
fold
increase
in
traffic
,
which
is
significantly
beating
our
expectations
-
seo
is
a
process
that
takes
time
and
to
get
results
this
quickly
is
exceptional
.

we
are
absolutely
confident
that
stuart
's
ethical
and
focused
strategies
will
see
these
trends
continue
to
grow
,
and
our
business
will
reap
the
rewards
of
this
program
.

finally
,
it
must
be
said
that
stuart
is
a
fantastic
person
to
work
with
,
because
of
his
solid
strategies
and
equally
as
importantly
because
he
is
a
genuinely
good
person
and
a
great
communicator
.

excellent
service
and
quality

i
had
hom
-
excel
replace
most
of
the
windows
in
my
tampa
residence
three
years
ago
.

the
excellent
windows
have
performed
without
any
problems
,
but
that
's
not
why
i
'm
writing
my
review
.

three
weeks
ago
,
burglars
tried
to
gain
entry
into
the
rear
of
my
home
.

the
intruders
slit
the
screen
of
the
window
.

next
,
they
tried
to
force
the
window
with
a
pry
bar
and
then
to
break
the
window
with
a
hammer
.

the
window
did
n't
break
!

my
next
-
door
neighbor
heard
the
noise
and
turned
on
a
light
,
thankfully
scaring
the
two
miscreants
away
(
they
even
left
their
hammer
behind
!
)
.

i
called
home
-
excel
the
next
day
to
order
a
replacement
screen
for
the
window
,
and
was
happily
surprised
when
they
said
that
they
were
n't
even
going
to
charge
me
for
the
replacement
screen
...
that
it
would
be
covered
under
their
guarentee
.

lo
and
behold
,
they
replaced
the
screen
(
which
had
to
be
ordered
)
yesterday
and
did
n't
charge
me
a
dime
.

their
worker
even
cleaned
3
of
my
windows
and
changed
a
lightbulb
for
me
.

in
this
day
and
age
,
it
is
so
rare
to
find
a
company
with
such
nice
workers
and
such
far
ranging
guarantee
policies
.

i
rarely
write
reviews
such
as
this
one
,
but
they
certainly
deserve
anyone
's
business
!

friendly
staff
,
but
definitely
some
problems

may
,
2009
.

we
were
booked
at
the
sheraton
with
a
number
of
other
out
-
of
-
town
wedding
guests
.

got
put
into
the
wrong
room
the
first
night
,
and
were
quite
surprised
to
have
someone
with
the
same
room
key
trying
to
get
in
the
door
at
1:00
am
!

next
day
got
moved
into
another
room
,
on
the
same
floor
with
other
wedding
guests
.

there
were
3
adults
in
our
room
but
towels
for
only
2
,
no
linens
for
sofa
bed
.

in
the
second
room
it
took
3
tries
to
get
all
the
towels
and
linens
we
requested
.

a
package
and
some
wedding
cards
were
left
in
our
first
room
.

they
were
sent
to
our
second
room
and
had
been
opened
--
the
ribbon
-
wrapped
present
,
and
all
3
envelopes
.

security
in
the
hotel
seemed
to
be
excellent
,
but
we
were
never
given
an
explanation
as
to
why
someone
would
open
these
items
.

a
mid-afternoon
"
fire
drill
"
was
disruptive
,
putting
everyone
out
of
the
hotel
.

when
we
called
the
front
desk
about
an
extremely
boisterous
crowd
in
the
hall
outside
our
door
quite
late
at
night
,
it
seemed
to
take
the
hotel
staff
quite
a
while
to
quiet
them
down
.

the
staff
was
friendly
,
especially
the
front
desk
female
supervisor
,
and
seemed
to
want
to
help
,
but
too
many
unusual
things
happened
to
make
us
want
to
stay
there
again
.

be
careful
of
who
your
sales
guy
is

i
think
this
place
is
probably
really
great
especially
judging
by
the
reviews
on
here
.

my
experience
was
awful
though
.

it
all
had
to
do
with
the
sales
guy
which
was
a
young
22
year
old
who
had
admittedly
only
been
working
for
2
weeks
.

i
was
extremely
interested
in
the
car
and
very
likely
would
have
bought
it
,
but
the
sales
guy
i
dealt
with
ruined
the
deal
.

essentially
,
i
told
him
i
did
n't
trust
him
cause
he
was
a
car
salesman
,
but
he
got
so
incredibly
offended
at
that
statement
that
he
had
to
go
cry
to
another
salesman
and
compose
himself
before
coming
back
.

i
do
n't
know
if
the
kid
had
a
bad
day
or
what
,
but
i
had
to
sit
and
apologize
about
nothing
for
10
minutes
until
he
dropped
the
issue
.

after
that
,
i
just
tried
to
ignore
his
lack
of
professionalism
and
test
drive
the
car
.

i
played
dumb
and
asked
him
questions
that
i
already
knew
the
answers
to
and
he
responded
with
half
truths
and
a
few
falsehoods
.

for
instance
i
asked
who
owned
mazda
and
he
said
with
confidence
that
was
gm
,
which
is
n't
true
.

i
mean
,
i
do
n't
care
if
he
does
n't
know
,
but
if
he
pretends
to
know
and
tells
me
bs
to
my
face
,
there
's
no
way
i
'm
going
to
trust
him
when
matters
turn
to
the
price
of
the
car
and
financing
.

the
worst
chinese
i
've
ever
had

this
is
by
far
the
worst
chinese
food
i
have
ever
had
.

the
service
stunk
.

i
called
in
my
order
and
upon
arriving
to
pick
it
up
,
they
got
my
order
confused
with
someone
else
s
.

they
helped
about
three
other
people
before
they
offered
to
help
me
again
.

they
also
got
my
friend
s
order
mixed
up
and
wanted
to
charger
her
$
10
more
than
what
she
had
wanted
.

she
asked
for
the
dinner
combo
and
they
gave
her
two
dinner
plates
instead
.

we
were
standing
in
the
store
for
20
minutes
to
simply
pick
up
an
order
.

not
to
mention
that
the
wait
staff
was
about
as
pleasant
as
dealing
with
an
angry
bull
.

they
were
abrasive
and
rude
-
when
they
were
the
ones
who
messed
everything
up
.

we
had
to
throw
out
about
80
percent
of
our
meals
because
the
food
tasted
so
horrible
.

i
do
nt
know
how
it
is
possible
to
make
orange
chicken
,
sesame
chicken
and
kung
pao
chicken
as
well
as
cheese
puffs
taste
that
bad
but
china
delight
accomplished
that
.

the
only
thing
that
was
edible
was
the
steamed
rice
and
the
vegetable
lo
mein
was
barely
tolerable
.

i
will
never
go
here
again
.

lucky
panda
in
willis
is
a
billion
times
better
in
service
and
quality
of
the
meal
.

i
have
no
idea
how
china
delight
won
number
1
chinese
restaurant
in
montgomery
-
there
needs
to
be
a
recount
on
that
vote
.

terrible
service

one
of
the
worst
experiences
i
've
ever
had
with
a
auto
repair
shop
.

we
took
our
vehicle
in
for
a
repair
to
the
air
conditioning
.

approx
4
months
later
,
the
compressor
went
out
.

we
took
it
back
in
to
have
it
repaired
again
,
and
less
than
a
week
later
the
second
compressor
went
out
.

we
went
in
for
a
third
visit
and
they
fixed
it
again
,
but
this
time
when
we
picked
up
the
car
,
the
radio
and
clock
did
not
work
.

so
for
the
4th
time
in
5
months
and
the
third
time
in
2
weeks
,
we
brought
the
car
back
again
.

when
we
expressed
our
discontent
to
the
manager
(
that
's
right
,
the
manager
)
,
did
he
say
he
would
return
some
money
,
did
he
say
he
would
give
a
discount
on
our
next
visit
,
did
he
just
say
"
i
'm
sorry
"
.

nope
,
none
of
the
above
.

he
stood
there
and
told
us
how
he
was
n't
at
fault
.

it
was
the
fault
of
the
parts
supplier
,
and
can
we
imagine
how
he
felt
having
to
put
another
2
hours
of
work
in
the
car
.

and
what
did
we
expect
...
that
he
bench
test
every
part
.

at
no
time
during
the
conversation
did
the
words
,
"
i
'm
sorry
"
ever
come
out
of
his
mouth
.

i
,
nor
anyone
else
in
my
family
,
will
ever
go
to
sun
devil
auto
again
.

well
,
unless
of
course
the
third
compressor
he
put
in
the
car
goes
out
.

do
not
use
this
company
!

i
dropped
off
a
sheet
metal
piece
that
i
needed
copied
due
to
th
it
was
needing
to
be
replaced
.

i
asked
if
they
could
copy
the
piece
i
dropped
off
.

they
said
it
would
be
made
exactly
like
the
one
i
needed
to
replace
.

i
picked
it
up
when
it
was
finished
and
was
charge
30.00
.

when
i
got
to
the
job
and
tried
to
insert
the
new
piece
of
metal
it
would
not
fit
!!

i
took
the
original
piece
of
metal
and
rigged
it
to
make
due
since
i
had
to
complete
the
job
.

i
took
the
receipt
and
the
metal
that
did
not
fit
and
asked
pomper
for
my
money
back
.

the
girl
at
the
desk
was
sooo
rude
i
could
not
believe
it
!

she
told
me
she
could
not
use
the
piece
i
was
returning
and
the
company
would
only
put
it
in
the
trash
so
i
could
not
return
it
.

i
explained
i
did
not
get
what
i
paid
for
.

she
asked
me
to
bring
the
original
piece
back
and
i
told
her
i
had
to
use
it
on
the
job
.

she
told
me
that
was
to
bad
she
would
do
nothing
to
help
me
since
she
could
not
use
or
resell
the
piece
.

i
said
i
was
going
to
trash
it
also
and
could
i
at
least
have
a
credit
.

with
a
smirk
on
her
face
she
told
me
no
money
is
being
returned
and
that
is
the
way
it
was
.

do
not
use
this
company
.

there
are
to
many
people
that
need
our
business
to
have
to
put
up
with
this
unfair
treatment
!!!!!

i
would
never
recommend
this
gym
to
anyone
and
unfortunately
this
is
based
solely
on
the
owner
's
own
unprofessionalism
.

when
i
originally
joined
in
january
i
only
did
so
because
i
was
told
i
would
be
able
to
cancel
the
12
month
membership
if
i
was
to
move
away
.

i
signed
up
with
one
of
the
staff
who
was
very
pleasant
and
professional
.

actually
working
out
there
was
good
-
the
machines
are
nice
and
the
classes
are
fun
.

the
locker
room
is
certainly
lacking
-
i
would
never
shower
or
change
there
.

they
need
to
update
the
locker
rooms
asap
.

back
to
my
poor
rating
-
i
was
excepted
to
medical
school
and
went
in
to
cancel
my
membership
as
i
was
told
i
could
do
since
i
was
moving
away
.

the
owner
was
very
rude
,
accused
me
of
not
reading
my
contract
,
and
basically
told
me
to
shut
up
when
i
was
trying
to
ask
questions
to
further
understand
the
process
of
canceling
my
membership
.

i
was
able
to
cancel
it
but
only
after
paying
a
$
50
fee
(
which
the
staff
person
who
signed
me
up
stated
i
would
not
have
to
pay
if
i
had
proof
of
moving
)
and
being
spoken
to
in
a
very
belittling
manner
.

i
would
understand
if
i
was
being
treated
this
way
by
a
staff
member
but
the
club
's
actual
owner
?!

bad
for
business
.

i
was
appalled
.

i
will
never
recommend
this
gym
to
any
woman
.

the
equipment
and
classes
are
n't
good
enough
to
deal
with
the
rudeness
from
the
staff
!!!

there
are
better
places
on
the
cape
-
fitness

the
salon
experience
from
hell

i
feel
obligated
to
share
this
story
.

right
out
of
college
i
called
the
salon
and
explained
my
situation
.

just
graduated
,
just
moved
,
not
rich
,
and
starting
new
job
soon
.

i
never
got
a
price
quote
over
the
phone
and
they
take
your
cc
info
just
to
make
the
appointment
because
if
you
do
n't
show
up
,
they
'll
charge
you
.

i
had
this
ridiculous
celebrity
stylist
from
la
named
derrick
.

after
he
already
put
product
on
my
hair
he
said
"
i
should
warn
you
,
i
'm
expensive
.
"

what
was
i
supposed
to
do
,
say
i
ca
n't
afford
you
and
walk
out
with
crap
all
over
my
hair
.

i
wanted
to
be
very
blonde
and
instead
he
pulled
my
root
color
throughout
my
whole
hair
which
is
a
gross
mousey
brown
.

the
other
stylists
around
me
kept
pressuring
me
saying
he
's
so
wonderful
,
you
're
going
to
love
your
hair
.

$
400
later
my
jaw
dropped
when
the
receptionist
told
me
the
total
.

derrick
did
a
terrible
job
,
was
a
complete
jerk
the
entire
time
,
and
i
had
no
warning
as
to
the
price
.

i
cried
the
entire
way
home
.

he
then
"
fixed
"
it
for
free
but
it
still
looked
like
crap
.

i
will
never
go
back
.

it
was
the
salon
experience
from
absolutely
hell
.

he
also
told
me
that
he
worked
on
the
cast
of
will
and
grace
and
that
they
were
all
jerks
.

that
's
my
favorite
show
of
all
time
.

i
'm
pretty
sure
for
the
cast
that
it
was
the
other
way
around
.

maybe
he
did
n't
do
a
good
job
and
they
told
him
so
.

absolute
nightmare
!

stay
away
!

very
unhappy
...

working
with
rod
jacobsen
was
my
first
experience
working
with
a
cpa
,
so
i
did
not
know
what
to
expect
.

that
said
-
he
seemed
to
be
doing
well
enough
.

however
,
then
i
asked
to
amend
my
return
to
apply
a
credit
i
had
just
become
eligible
for
.

i
expected
to
pay
for
this
service
,
but
imagine
my
surprise
when
i
received
a
bill
for
more
than
what
i
paid
to
have
the
original
return
prepared
.

asked
why
,
rod
simply
told
me
that
he
had
to
research
how
to
do
the
amendment
(
it
was
an
amended
to
show
that
i
had
purchased
a
home
-
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
,
one
would
think
)
and
that
took
time
to
figure
out
.

well
,
that
was
strike
one
.

i
was
n't
going
to
use
them
again
,
but
i
was
going
to
leave
it
at
that
.

however
,
now
that
i
have
come
to
realize
that
i
am
going
to
owe
the
irs
$
6,000
+
despite
doing
exactly
what
rod
told
me
to
do
,
i
feel
i
have
to
voice
my
opinion
.

last
year
,
after
all
was
said
and
done
,
i
asked
rod
whether
my
payment
structure
would
leave
me
with
no
/
little
tax
liability
at
the
end
of
the
year
.

he
said
yes
.

well
,
again
,
i
am
now
faced
with
a
tax
bill
of
$
6,000
+
,
all
due
on
april
15
,
2010
and
all
that
rod
has
to
say
to
the
matter
is
'
well
,
you
wo
n't
have
to
pay
a
penalty
.
'

i
may
not
have
to
pay
a
penalty
,
yet
,
but
this
is
not
what
i
had
in
mind
when
hired
these
guys
.

in
the
words
of
my
new
accountant
,
they
let
me
down
!

bit
sketchy
,
sporadic
delivery
times

i
bought
about
half
of
the
furniture
i
own
from
this
place
.

why
?

because
they
cut
me
good
deals
if
i
paid
in
cash
.

sketchy
,
right
?

well
they
came
through
and
delivered
almost
all
of
my
items
within
a
few
days
.

(
they
even
got
me
a
couch
pretty
quickly
.
)

the
guy
who
was
cutting
me
the
deals
and
getting
me
the
furniture
quickly
,
ahmed
,
was
nice
and
mostly
professional
,
except
the
semi-sketchiness
.

then
one
day
,
ahmed
left
the
country
,
not
to
return
for
months
,
without
informing
me
.

he
also
neglected
to
tell
the
other
person
working
at
the
store
about
a
dining
room
table
that
i
had
ordered
and
that
was
supposed
to
be
coming
in
.

the
other
person
working
at
the
store
did
n't
know
that
i
still
had
this
table
coming
.

i
had
paid
in
cash
,
and
he
said
he
had
no
receipt
/
record
of
my
purchase
.

i
came
back
with
the
receipt
ahmed
had
provided
upon
my
purchase
,
and
the
guy
took
forever
to
copy
it
but
said
that
he
would
take
care
of
the
situation
.

i
waited
.

and
waited
.

he
never
once
contacted
us
.

i
've
had
to
pester
this
new
guy
several
times
to
ask
when
my
table
will
arrive
.

he
kept
saying
different
arrival
/
delivery
dates
and
did
n't
seem
terribly
apologetic
.

it
has
been
3
weeks
and
i
still
do
n't
have
my
table
(
which
was
not
cheap
,
i
might
add
)
.

point
is
:
you
might
be
able
to
get
a
good
deal
on
some
nice
furniture
--
which
i
did
--
but
they
're
not
very
communicative
and
god
forbid
something
goes
wrong
,
you
'll
have
to
fight
to
get
it
resolved
.

poor
service

run
do
n't
walk
.

my
experience
with
home
delivery
service
has
been
one
of
disappointment
and
anger
.

if
i
could
give
them
a
lower
rating
than
poor
i
would
.

on
august
21st
,
2009
i
ordered
furniture
from
hickory
furniture
mart
and
contracted
for
hds
to
deliver
it
.

after
seventeen
days
the
delivery
van
showed
up
at
my
home
minus
two
pieces
.

i
was
later
told
they
had
been
left
at
the
warehouse
and
some
future
date
they
would
be
delivered
.

no
one
will
give
me
a
date
.

i
spent
$
2300
on
the
bedroom
suite
,
which
was
complete
and
excellent
condition
on
the
showroom
floor
.

upon
delivery
it
was
clear
the
entire
set
was
damaged
:
a
piece
of
wood
was
broke
on
the
headboard
;
the
chest
of
drawers
was
missing
all
four
pieces
necessary
to
attach
the
legs
;
the
dresser
back
legs
were
pushed
in
causing
the
dresser
to
lean
into
the
wall
;
and
a
nighstand
was
missing
a
drawer
.

how
do
you
lose
a
drawer
.

after
complaining
on
september
10th
to
national
home
furnishings
,
boyles
,
the
hickory
furniture
mart
and
home
delivery
service
the
latter
finally
called
me
back
and
said
they
would
be
up
to
pick
the
dresser
and
chest
of
drawers
at
some
future
point
and
at
some
later
point
it
would
be
professional
repaired
and
at
some
later
point
it
would
be
returned
.

the
customer
service
at
home
delivery
service
was
terrible
let
alone
their
promise
to
proper
set
up
furniture
.

so
i
am
in
limbo
regarding
a
bedroom
suite
.

i
hope
the
owners
and
employees
of
this
store
have
broken
bedroom
suites
in
their
homes
and
furniture
sitting
in
someone
's
warehouse
.

maybe
then
they
will
begin
to
understand
poor
customer
service
and
terrible
sit
up
service
.

excellent
driving
school

i
was
involved
in
a
car
accident
20
years
ago
and
since
then
i
've
been
a
nervous
wreck
and
have
n't
been
behind
the
wheel
.

unfortunately
,
a
family
emergency
required
me
to
conquer
this
fear
.

a
very
good
friend
of
mine
highly
recommended
the
professional
driving
school
and
i
was
told
to
specifically
ask
for
gerry
.

she
highly
recommended
him
and
described
him
as
the
"
saintly
instructor
and
simply
the
best
instructor
there
is
....
very
calm
,
pleasant
and
very
detailed
in
giving
instructions
"
.

i
called
the
school
most
probably
10
times
before
i
finally
enrolled
in
a
20
hour
package
.

i
had
to
cancel
my
initial
lesson
4
times
and
on
the
5th
attempt
the
management
was
quick
enough
to
associate
my
cancellations
with
my
fear
and
finally
encouraged
me
into
taking
my
initial
lesson
.

five
minutes
before
my
initial
lesson
,
i
got
a
call
from
gerry
advising
me
of
his
arrival
and
to
come
down
as
soon
as
i
was
ready
.

my
heart
pounded
as
i
walked
down
and
pounded
even
faster
upon
seeing
gerry
in
an
suv
-
lexus
!

i
thought
of
canceling
the
lesson
once
again
because
i
did
n't
feel
comfortable
driving
an
suv
.

gerry
pleasantly
said
"
since
i
am
already
here
why
do
n't
we
give
it
shot
.

i
trust
you
and
believe
that
you
'll
be
able
to
handle
this
and
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
reciprocate
!

trust
me
and
most
especially
trust
and
believe
in
yourself
.

do
n't
worry
,
i
'll
take
care
of
you
!
"

.......
the
rest
was
history
!

here
i
am
now
driving
confidently
on
my
own
.

gerry
,
i
ca
n't
thank
you
enough
for
helping
me
cope
with
my
fear
.

to
my
friend
,
thank
you
for
your
recommendation
...
you
were
true
to
your
words
in
saying
gerry
is
a
"
saintly
instructor
...
absolutely
simple
the
best
instructor
and
best
driving
school
there
is
!

review
on
house
of
joy
chinese
restaurant

my
family
and
i
moved
to
san
antonio
a
year
ago
and
have
tried
almost
all
of
the
chinese
restaurants
because
we
love
chinese
food
.

well
it
took
us
a
while
to
find
one
that
we
liked
.

but
we
do
n't
just
like
house
of
joy
we
love
it
.

everything
we
have
gotten
there
has
been
more
authentic
and
better
tasting
than
any
other
chinese
restaurant
in
the
san
antonio
area
we
have
been
to
--
and
trust
me
we
have
been
to
a
lot
of
them
.

we
just
happen
to
stumble
across
this
little
restaurant
one
day
when
we
had
to
visit
the
bexar
county
tax
office
off
of
bandera
road
.

we
stopped
in
and
got
some
take
out
and
can
not
stop
going
back
.

they
have
the
best
egg
drop
soup
i
have
ever
tasted
.

we
also
love
their
egg
rolls
and
spring
rolls
.

and
every
entree
we
have
ordered
is
perfect
.

everything
is
always
cooked
fresh
and
tastes
fresh
.

their
prices
are
extremely
reasonable
for
the
amount
of
food
you
receive
.

the
staff
is
also
just
so
pleasant
to
deal
with
.

they
are
also
quick
at
getting
your
order
out
to
you
.

you
do
n't
have
to
sit
and
wait
around
forever
like
most
places
!!

so
anyone
looking
for
an
excellent
night
out
for
chinese
or
maybe
just
lunch
should
stop
in
and
try
it
because
i
promise
you
2
things
---
you
wo
n't
regret
it
!!

and
you
will
go
back
for
more
!!!

granger

ps
i
have
noticed
on
here
that
someone
left
a
comment
that
"
all
of
the
nice
comments
must
come
from
co
workers
or
friends
"
and
i
will
tell
you
that
i
do
n't
know
these
people
except
from
eating
at
their
restaurant
.

we
are
from
virginia
and
just
moved
here
a
year
ago
.

so
that
comment
is
completely
false
.

because
we
think
it
's
the
best
!!!

and
we
do
n't
know
them
except
for
eating
there
.

dr.
strzalka
at
flagship
cvts
is
not
a
good
doctor

i
am
not
sure
about
the
quality
of
the
other
doctors
there
,
but
i
do
know
from
personal
experience
that
dr.
christopher
t.
strzalka
is
not
a
man
of
his
word
,
and
is
also
very
cruel
and
uncaring
!!

he
was
going
to
operate
and
replace
my
bicuspid
aortic
valve
due
to
critical
aortic
stenosis
.

i
had
a
surgery
date
of
july
17
,
2008
.

then
he
renigged
when
he
read
my
health
care
proxy
,
even
though
i
agreed
to
be
on
the
ventilator
for
2
months
following
surgery
(
as
he
had
twice
stated
i
must
agree
to
)
.

he
later
said
that
by
2
months
he
"
meant
at
least
two
months
"
.

two
months
and
at
least
two
months
are
totally
different
things
.

he
did
not
even
give
me
the
chance
to
say
i
would
stay
on
the
ventilator
longer
,
which
i
would
have
.

a
health
care
proxy
is
not
written
in
stone
and
can
be
changed
.

he
also
never
even
said
he
was
sorry
.

just
said
i
was
inoperable
and
walked
out
of
the
hospital
room
.

so
,
therefore
,
now
he
says
i
am
inoperable
(
even
though
i
am
not
100
%
inoperable
)
,
and
he
is
letting
me
die
.

i
am
just
middle
aged
and
do
not
want
to
die
,
but
thanks
to
this
doctor
i
have
no
other
alternatives
.

i
,
along
with
my
friends
,
consider
this
doctor
to
be
the
cause
of
my
death
as
he
is
not
even
trying
to
save
my
life
by
operating
.

even
my
pa
i
went
to
the
other
day
said
"
it
must
by
comforting
to
have
gone
to
a
heart
surgeon
like
him
who
will
do
nothing
for
you
"
.

he
said
it
sarcastically
.

if
you
want
a
doctor
who
will
lie
to
you
and
say
he
will
operate
and
then
change
his
mind
,
and
not
know
what
he
is
talking
about
when
he
recommends
procedures
at
other
hospitals
and
says
they
are
what
you
need
,
when
they
will
not
work
for
you
,
go
to
this
doctor
...
he
is
the
one
for
you
.

what
you
can
learn
from
the
below
'
bad
experience
'
.

i
would
suggest
not
avoiding
second
home
based
on
the
'
bad
experience
'
review
.

i
'd
probably
be
more
inclined
to
board
my
two
dogs
here
,
seeing
that
they
do
n't
just
take
every
dog
coming
in
.

i
've
toured
this
place
and
was
impressed
by
how
clean
the
place
was
,
and
all
the
options
for
the
dogs
.

it
's
unfortunate
that
bmil
believed
that
his
'
perfect
'
dog
was
not
given
the
right
opportunity
to
prove
himself
.

but
i
've
done
hundreds
of
dog
introductions
myself
(
another
place
,
i
do
n't
work
here
)
,
and
owners
can
have
unrealistic
expectations
and
views
of
what
they
see
when
their
dogs
meet
other
dogs
.

workers
who
do
these
introductions
look
at
the
interaction
objectively
;
and
it
's
good
to
see
they
are
able
and
willing
to
say
no
if
they
feel
there
would
be
a
problem
.

it
sounds
(
according
to
your
own
statement
)
that
they
had
a
roomful
of
dogs
,
so
they
must
be
doing
something
right
-
and
are
keeping
those
dogs
safe
from
potential
problems
.

you
say
you
work
a
lot
,
and
that
you
have
a
young
dog
;
so
i
have
little
doubt
that
your
dog
is
just
filled
with
energy
to
burn
;
and
it
is
good
of
you
to
look
for
a
place
to
take
him
.

but
not
at
a
risk
to
other
people
's
pets
.

you
were
clearly
given
another
alternative
by
second
home
,
to
board
him
-
which
might
have
given
your
dog
a
chance
to
come
and
go
from
second
home
a
couple
times
,
getting
used
to
the
place
and
maybe
facilitating
another
attempt
to
get
into
daycare
later
.

no
business
is
going
to
push
customers
away
without
good
reason
;
so
is
n't
it
reasonable
to
think
they
might
know
what
they
're
doing
?

my
dogs
are
far
from
perfect
,
and
one
of
them
i
believe
would
be
a
little
much
for
daycare
here
herself
(
at
least
initially
)
.

be
a
little
more
reasonable
with
your
expectations
of
a
place
like
this
;
and
maybe
do
n't
jump
to
personal
attacks
suggesting
that
they
do
n't
want
to
work
hard
,
just
because
you
bruised
your
own
ego
.

dumbest
f'ers
ever

i
called
dominos
tonight
,
it
rang
forever
,
i
get
put
on
hold
twice
without

say

i
say

street
and
i
am
3
blocks
west

.

hmmm
,
she
says
,
then
why
are
you
calling
here
,
we
do
n't
go
past
broad
?

anyway
,
after
much
yelling
and
cussing
i
hung
up
,
grabbed
a
cab
,
and
went
to
geno
's
.

quick
to
take
money
but
not
quick
to
fix
a
problem
!

b&b
came
out
very
quickly
to
give
us
our
quote
back
in
june
.

they
were
very
polite
,
eager
to
answer
any
questions
and
willing
to
wait
for
us
to
return
from
vacation
to
begin
installing
our
fence
.

our
fence
was
installed
quickly
in
august
and
they
had
their
money
and
left
saying
"
workmanship
is
guaranteed
for
a
year
!
"
.

within
a
week
we
noticed
one
of
the
boards
on
our
gate
splitting
where
a
nail
had
gone
in
.

we
called
our
representative
who
assured
me
he
would
call
the
office
and
have
it
taken
care
of
.

we
heard
nothing
.

we
then
called
the
office
and
the
man
we
spoke
to
said
he
'd
send
someone
out
to
look
at
it
but
could
n't
promise
when
-
two
weeks
came
and
went
and
we
heard
nothing
.

i
just
called
again
and
was
told
that
workmanship
,
not
wood
,
is
guaranteed
for
a
year
-
well
in
my
opinion
-
the
wood
split
due
to
a
nail
which
is
part
of
workmanship
!

she
even
went
so
far
as
to
say
"
you
r
calling
about
one
board
?
"

well
-
when
you
pay
over
$
1000
for
something
you
want
it
to
hold
up
and
look
good
!!!

yes
!

i
was
calling
about
one
board
!!

i
'm
very
frustrated
at
this
point
-
it
would
take
all
of
10
min
for
them
to
come
by
and
replace
the
one
board
that
is
cracked
(
the
crack
is
deep
enough
to
stick
a
penny
in
it
and
it
goes
clear
through
)
yet
they
do
not
want
to
take
the
time
to
bother
with
what
once
was
a
happy
customer
and
has
now
become
a
dissatisfied
customer
.

so
i
figure
if
they
do
n't
want
to
take
the
time
to
fix
the
fence
that
they
installed
then
i
'll
take
the
time
to
let
everyone
i
can
know
about
how
they
treat
customers
once
they
have
your
money
!!!

stay
away
!!!

you
get
what
you
pay
for
!!!

they
came
in
under
a
lot
of
other
quotes
and
now
i
know
why
!!!

when
the
fence
was
first
installed
i
would
have
given
them
five
stars
,
now
for
their
poor
customer
follow
-
up
and
unwillingness
to
fix
the
fence
they
have
dropped
to
a
one
-
star
in
my
opinion
!

lots
of
rules
,
phantom
innkeeper
,
last
minute
price
was
worth
it
.

i
called
the
"
207
"
number
and
listened
to
the
same
recording
loop
3
times
before
i
gave
up
.

i
then
called
the
800
number
(
which
was
answered
)
and
inquired
about
last
minute
rates
.

they
had
a
room
with
a
$
99
rate
,
which
i
booked
.

the
room
was
supposed
to
be
on
the
2nd
floor
,
but
they
put
us
on
the
3rd
.

the
email
confirmation
(
which
i
read
in
the
car
)
warned
about
large
suitcases
,
declaring
that
we
are
innkeepers
,
not
longshoreman
.

in
other
words
,
they
do
not
help
with
suitcases
,
but
they
promise
totes
to
help
.

however
upon
our
arrival
no
one
there
(
the
inn
was
open
)
.

so
no
totes
.

finally
a
chambermaid
stuck
her
head
around
the
corner
from
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
told
us
sternly
that
we
could
not
be
accommodated
until
3
m
,
no
exceptions
.

then
she
was
gone
.

we
returned
after
3
pm
,
found
no
one
there
,
and
a
note
from
the
innkeeper
with
directions
to
our
room
.

i
would
n't

quit
with
the
overstatements
!

the
worst
thing
that
can
happen
for
any
restaurant
like
zahav
is
to
have
too
many
people
write
hyperbolic
reviews
making
claims
that
"
everyone
"
is
going
to
"
love
"
the
food
,
decor
and
service
.

the
truth
is
,
in
my
and
my
dining
partners
'
experience
,
this
is
a
fine
little
restaurant
with
some
unique
food
.

it
's
an
entirely
up
and
down
experience
,
however
.

now
,
the
best
of
that
unique
food
comes
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
meal
.

the
salatim
salads
are
the
smallest
plates
i
've
ever
seen
placed
in
front
of
me
(
you
would
most
likely
think
they
were
condiments
if
it
were
n't
explained
to
you
)
.

though
they
are
mostly
excellent
,
you
generally
do
n't
get
enough
forkfuls
to
know
if
you
really
love
them
.

that
being
said
,
the
laffa
and
hummus
are
out
of
this
world
.

then
again
,
for
the
three
of
us
who
dined
together
,
two
pieces
of
flatbread
left
us
fighting
for
more
,
and
licking
the
hummus
from
our
fingers
(
and
yes
,
those
two
pieces
of
flatbread
did
represent
a
three
-
person
order
)
.

dinner
was
also
an
up
-
and
-
down
experience
.

the
vegetarian
dishes
and
lighter
fare
were
almost
always
spot
-
on
,
while
the
lamb
was
often
dry
and
/
or
overcooked
.

the
duck
was
a
65
%
glob
of
chewy
fat
with
no
resemblance
to
the
juicy
,
crispy
delicacy
it
usually
represents
at
other
establishments
.

dessert
was
...
hmmm
,
that
's
interesting
,
i
do
n't
even
remember
dessert
.

i
guess
that
tells
you
a
lot
.

oh
,
yes
,
the
chocolate
semifreddo
was
quite
good
.

the
warm
chocolate
cake
was
very
tasty
,
but
served
at
room
temperature
,
not
warm
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
.

and
my
--
no
,
i
still
do
n't
remember
what
i
had
.

service
was
average
,
but
nothing
special
,
and
restaurants
that
are
supposed
to
be
excellent
should
do
a
better
job
of
training
their
waitstaff
to
be
communicative
and
friendly
,
not
merely
capable
.

perhaps
had
we
not
gone
into
this
restaurant
believing
zahav
was
going
to
be
golden
as
its
name
suggests
(
and
as
the
many
golden
reviews
seem
to
attest
)
,
we
would
have
enjoyed
a
decent
little
expensive
experience
.

but
one
should
not
go
here
expecting
something
fantastic
,
unless
perhaps
you
've
never
had
middle
-
eastern
food
before
,
or
succulent
duck
,
tasty
lamb
,
decent
portion
sizes
or
actually
warm
chocolate
desserts
.

ps
)
when
we
called
for
a
reservation
,
we
were
told
that
5:00
and
9:30
were
their
only
openings
.

when
we
arrived
at
5
,
and
left
circa
7
,
there
were
the
same
4
or
5
empty
tables
surrounding
us
.

did
they
think
we
were
going
to
feel
lucky
to
get
any
reservation
at
all
,
and
therefore
be
more
pleased
with
our
dining
experience
?

must
read
-
do
not
waste
your
time
in
this
store
.

at
my
appointment
the
girl
helping
me
was
unable
to
adequately
lace
up
some
of
the
dresses
.

they
felt
like
they
were
going
to
fall
off
of
me
and
it
was
very
difficult
to
see
what
i
would
actually
look
like
were
i
to
purchase
some
of
these
dresses
.

i
thought
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
see
how
a
few
that
i
liked
would
look
like
on
a
model
(
by
looking
the
dress
up
online
)
.

so
,
as
i
was
leaving
i
asked
for
the
designer
/
dress
name
or
style
number
associated
with
my
top
picks
.

they
said
they
were
"
unable
to
tell
me
until
they
ordered
my
dress
"
.

hmmm
...
a
person
can
not
call
a
company
,
if
you
have
no
idea
its
name
(
since
the
designer
is
unknown
...
supposedly
)
,
and
order
a
gown
without
a
dress
name
or
style
number
.

do
other
brides
fall
for
this
???

they
either
:
a
)
do
n't
want
to
give
it
to
me
because
they
do
n't
want
me
purchasing
the
dress
elsewhere
or
b
)
are
recreating
the
dresses
themselves
(
ie
stealing
other
designers
'
dress
designs
and
"
filling
the
orders
"
by
their
own
seamstresses
)
.

i
'm
no
detective
but
...
uhh
...
seriously
?!?

whatever
type
of
operation
they
are
running
,
i
'm
not
interested
and
if
you
're
smart
,
you
wo
n't
be
either
.

what
a
waste
of
time
.

aside
from
that
little
*
mystery
*
,
one
of
the
sales
ladies
was
quite
comfortable
telling
me
how
wrong
i
was
about
how
another
dress
that
i
loved
compared
to
one
of
her
dresses
that
i
was
trying
on
.

somehow
,
since
she
supposedly
does
n't
know
any
names
of
designers
/
dresses
,
after
i
told
her
the
designer
and
dress
name
of
the
one
i
was
comparing
,
she
knew
"
exactly
which
dress
"
i
was
referring
to
and
disagreed
with
my
observation
;
she
said
that
the
bodice
did
come
as
low
as
the
one
i
had
on
.

my
point
:
even
if
i
was
wrong
,
do
n't
sit
there
and
argue
with
the
customer
.

say
something
like
,
"
huh
.

i
did
n't
think
so
but
you
could
be
right
.
"

unless
you
want
to
take
the
"
tell
the
customer
how
wrong
she
is
and
try
and
force
her
into
a
dress
she
's
obviously
not
loving
"
approach
which
will
likely
get
you
...
uh
...
nowhere
.

seriously
:
do
not
waste
your
time
.

other
shops
around
this
city
have
much
nicer
and
more
transparent
owners
.

not
owners
that
seem
like
they
have
something
to
hide
and
know
nothing
about
common
courtesy
and
customer
service
.

i
felt
very
much
like
wedding
gallery
was
being
dishonest
and
i
would
n't
trust
them
to
lace
me
up
in
another
gown
let
alone
trust
them
with
the
gown
i
will
wear
on
the
most
important
day
of
my
life
.

awful
service
!

after
happily
visiting
sear's
automotives
in
the
past
,
i
was
shocked
at
the
horrible
service
received
at
their
greensboro
location
.

i
brought
my
car
in
on
a
sunday
to
replace
a
shredded
tire
.

i
waited
about
20
minutes
in
the
store
part
before
anyone
was
able
to
assist
me
and
was
then
told
to
pull
my
car
into
the
shop
(
that
is
apparently
what
you
are
supposed
to
do
,
but
the
big
signs
pointing
you
that
way
are
for
some
reason
kept
inside
the
garage
,
so
you
do
n't
see
them
drving
up
,
and
they
purposely
block
the
front
pull
-
up
that
all
other
sear's
use
)
.

once
inside
,
i
had
to
stand
around
for
at
least
10
more
minutes
before
--
finally
--
a
technician
got
to
me
.

once
i
returned
to
pick
up
my
car
,
you
can
believe
i
spent
quite
a
bit
more
time
standing
around
waiting
.

i
had
wanted
to
split
the
total
between
a
credit
card
and
check
card
since
i
was
being
reimbursed
for
the
tire
but
was
told
this
was
n't
possible
.

once
i
actually
got
back
in
my
car
,
it
was
dirty
and
had
grease
all
over
the
steering
wheel
.

ok
,
one
bad
experience
...
fine
.

the
following
friday
,
i
returned
with
my
car
to
go
ahead
and
replace
the
other
3
tires
,
which
were
worn
.

i
would
not
have
gone
back
,
but
i
could
n't
find
the
particular
tire
they
'd
used
in
stock
anywhere
else
.

once
again
,
i
waited
for
quite
a
bit
before
being
attended
to
.

i
got
the
order
completed
,
and
then
questioned
the
technician
since
it
came
out
about
$
40
less
than
i
expected
.

he
said
it
was
the
same
tire
,
and
verified
this
,
after
checking
both
the
actual
tire
on
my
car
and
my
service
papers
from
earlier
in
the
week
.

however
,
when
he
printed
out
the
service
quote
,
i
could
see
that
it
was
not
the
correct
tire
,
and
was
not
even
an
appropriate
tire
for
my
car
model
.

so
i
pointed
this
out
to
him
,
at
which
point
he
said
they
only
had
one
of
the
correct
tires
in
stock
.

ok
--
fine
.

so
i
got
just
my
other
rear
tire
replaced
.

they
promised
it
'd
be
done
within
an
hour
,
so
i
waited
in
the
lobby
.

over
two
hours
later
(
and
ten
minutes
before
they
closed
)
my
car
was
finally
finished
.

a
few
minutes
after
i
left
,
i
was
called
and
informed
that
"
i
"
left
my
wheel
lock
(
which
they
should
have
left
in
the
car
)
.

of
course
,
they
would
be
closing
in
5
minutes
,
so
i
would
have
to
hurry
up
or
get
it
the
next
day
.

of
course
i
could
n't
make
it
back
in
time
(
and
they
apparently
could
not
stay
5
extra
minutes
to
wait
for
me
)
.

the
next
day
,
no
one
could
find
my
wheel
lock
and
that
particular
technician
was
not
in
.

of
course
,
they
could
n't
call
him
either
to
ask
about
it
because
apparently
they
do
n't
keep
their
employees
'
phone
numbers
(
riiight
)
,
so
i
would
have
to
return
on
monday
(
driving
for
3
days
now
with
no
wheel
lock
should
i
get
a
flat
)
.

on
monday
i
called
and
again
it
was
a
big
to
-
do
to
find
anyone
who
knew
anything
about
it
.

supposedly
they
will
be
holding
it
for
me
this
evening
,
but
i
'm
sure
that
will
also
be
a
huge
ordeal
.

the
employees
at
this
sear's
are
completely
apathetic
and
there
did
n't
seem
to
be
any
sort
of
management
that
i
could
see
.

i
will
never
return
there
again
(
and
now
have
some
serious
doubts
about
the
quality
of
work
they
actually
performed
on
my
car
)
.

to
offer
,
i
am
out
ta
here
...

i
called
on
a
friday
at
12:30
complaining
of
a
severe
toothache
.

dr.
obina
told
me
that
his
office
closed
at
noon
and
that
i
should
call
him
on
monday
.

i
had
been
a
patient
of
dr.
olbina
for
9
years
and
had
spent
thousands
of
dollars
on
crowns
etc
.

there
are
plenty
of
good
dentists
in
fernandina
.

do
n't
go
to
amelia
gentle
dentistry
.

good
location

for
a
hotel
like
this
you
would
expect
some
form
of
free
internet
.

what
you
get
is
a
$
13
/
day
charge
to
access
the
internet
through
a
slow
512
/
512
kb
/
s
that
you
can
only
use
to
check
email
etc
(
read
:
no
downloading
)
.

other
than
that
the
hotel
is
in
a
good
location
and
the
breakfast
is
great

make
you
feel
like
a
number

stay
away
from
kids
first
west
chester
.

you
never
get
a
human
on
the
phone
.

it
's
impossible
to
get
an
appointment
.

if
you
get
caught
in
traffic
and
are
a
couple
minutes
late
they
make
you
re-schedule
...
for
6
weeks
later
.

and
worst
of
all
your
child
feels
like
a
number
not
a
patient
.

go
somewhere
else
.

from

to
the
spaghetti

and
the

and
ending
with
gelato
,
all
was

too

maybe
next

they
will
have
it

delivered
not
even
one
tenth
of
what
was
promised
.

apart
from
that
in
spite
of
my
repeated
attempts
i
could
not
get
in
touch
with
the
manager
to
even
lodge
an
official
complaint
.

my
advise
to
all
is
i
have
fallen
into
this
trap
...
pl
ensure
you
do
nt
!!!

course
has
come
a
long
way
!!

hcc
's
new
nine
was
a
little
shaky
at
first
,
but
the
new
grounds
superintendant
has
done
wonders
for
the
course
!!

the
comment
below
definitely
needs
to
be
retracted
!

come
back
and
give
hcc
a
second
chance
at
least
!

it
is
a
great
course
for
local
golfers
to
be
proud
of
and
all
the
comments
in
2008
have
been
very
positive
!!

excellent
physiotherapists
!

kusal
goonewardena
and
his
team
of
physios
are
unbelievable
!

i
have
been
suffering
from
back
pain
for
over
12
years
and
have
been
to
numerous
specialists
,
physios
,
osteos
and
chiros
with
no
help
.

it
took
the
vigor
team
only
4
visits
to
get
me
feeling
normal
!

and
now
2
months
after
my
last
appointment
i
am
better
than
ever
.

thanks
guys
!

they
must
have
read
these
reviews
and
improved
!

my
husband
and
i
happened
in
on
a
whim
.

we
sat
in
the
front
dining
area
,
it
was
very
cozy
and
pleasant
.

our
server
was
quite
attentive
and
the
food
was
fantastic
.

my
husband
has
been
a
professional
chef
,
so
he
is
a
good
judge
of
quality
food
.

this
was
a
flavorful
,
enjoyable
meal
for
both
of
us
.

rude
rude
rude

went
in
there
and
got
my
dog
groomed
came
home
to
an
uneven
dog
then
took
him
back
to
get
evened
up
what
a
mistake
!

she
did
nt
even
let
me
finish
a
sentence
without
insulting
me
and
telling
me
how
i
should
have
said
it
!

i
wo
nt
go
back
!

she
needs
to
develop
a
personality
!

brought
dog
home
and
it
s
all
choppy
now
!

it
's
helpful
to
know
a
quite
a
bit
about
bull
fighting
.

if
you
watch
a
lot
of
fights
(
youtube
)
and
research
some
of
the
history
(
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bullfighting
)
you
will
find
yourself
enjoying
it
a
lot
more
!

also
after
seeing
a
handful
of
bullfights
,
i
can
say
that
they
're
a
lot
more
enjoyable
if
you
're
smashed
(
bac
>=
.15
)
.

all
i
can
say
is
that
i
am
glad
i
went
in
!

the
nurses
are
sweet
as
pie
and
the
doctor
is
wonderful
.

this
place
is
about
healing
,
not
making
a
buck
.

the
followup
visit
is
free
!!

after
going
to
the
hospital
and
paying
er
prices
...
there
is
no
way
i
wo
n't
be
back
here
!!

i
will
be
back
and
telling
everyone
about
this
clinic
.

thank
you
!!

i
just
like
the
fact
that
he
was
able
to
do
the
specific
type
of
repair
i
wanted
(
a
reball
)
and
give
me
the
longest
warranty
and
even
a
lower
price
.

someone
else
i
found
that
said
they
could
do
it
but
wanted
to
charge
me
more
and
give
me
less
warranty
.

it
was
a
no
brainer
really
.

i
choose
console
pros
and
i
'm
happy
i
did
.

this
place
is
bad
.

it
's
dark
,
dingy
&
dirty
.

the
salads
are
limp
and
the
rest
of
the
food
is
n't
any
better
(
ok
,
the
nachos
are
not
too
bad
!
)

this
place
may
have
been
something
sometime
;
but
it
way
past
it
"
sell
by
date
"
.

i
have
eaten
here
twice
in
the
past
year
and
will
not
go
back
and
can
not
recommend
it
.

ham
s
on
friendly
...
rip

this
is
the
original
ham
's
restaurant
,
expanded
into
a
regional
chain
in
the
late
80's
--
but
this
one
is
no
more
.

victim
of
hard
times
and
i
suspect
failing
corporate
management
.

according
to
news
accounts
,
the
company
is
struggling
.

i
have
many
fond
memories
of
my
college
evenings
there
long
ago
.

so
long
ham
s
...
you
will
be
missed
.

we
are
very
pleased
with
the
services
of
first
glass
window
.

our
window
panes
were
so
dirty
that
they
needed
a
specialist
to
come
and
clean
them
.

we
called
few
companies
before
we
decide
to
hire
them
.

they
came
on
time
and
completed
their
work
quickly
.

we
were
very
happy
how
clean
looked
our
windows
.

if
you
have
some
problems
with
your
windows
,
you
should
call
them
.

great
help
even
near
closing
time
!

i
came
in
to
town
for
a
week
and
forgot
my
trainers
!

oh
no
!!

i
came
in
30
min
before
close
and
the
staff
was
super
helpful
.

they
spent
a
lot
of
time
with
me
and
got
me
into
a
great
pair
of
shoes
.

i
think
they
may
even
be
better
than
the
pair
i
have
been
using
this
past
year
!

thanks
run
on
!

great

this
is
a
perfect
place
to
get
your
hair
done
.

i
have
gone
there
time
and
time
again
whenever
i
need
to
get
my
hair
done
or
when
i
want
a
haircut
.

when
i
get
my
hair
done
there
,
they
use
enough
hairstyling
products
while
it
does
not
ruin
your
hair
.

the
service
is
great
and
during
weekends
it
tends
to
get
busy
,
but
the
wait
is
worthwhile
.

highly
recommend

i
have
worked
with
shannon
as
my
massage
therapist
and
intuitive
bodyworker
for
years
and
have
never
been
disappointed
.

no
matter
what
state
i
am
in
when
i
arrive
,
i
always
leave
feeling
better
.

she
has
not
only
helped
me
through
some
challenging
computer
-
work
and
sports
related
injuries
,
she
was
wonderful
to
work
with
throughout
my
pregnancy
and
beyond
.

i
highly
recommend
her
.

best
store
in
boothbay
harbor

what
a
fantastic
store
,
i
love
this
place
.

not
the
same
old
stuff
that
all
the
other
stores
have
.

their
items
are
very
unique
,
great
quality
,
great
prices
.

they
also
have
the
best
tea
i
ever
had
,
not
at
all
like
the
junk
you
get
at
the
grocery
stores
,
i
stock
up
when
ever
there
because
they
are
closed
in
the
winter
.

the
best

dr.
aster
and
her
team
have
been
a
strong
advocate
in
the
health
of
both
my
daughters
.

dr.
aster
is
very
kind
an
gentle
with
the
children
,
but
also
positive
and
to
the
point
with
the
parents
.

she
is
and
excellent
doctor
to
have
on
one
's
team
.

even
though
i
live
pretty
far
from
her
office
i
still
make
the
trip
so
my
daughters
will
have
the
best
!

my
wife
and
i
avoided
doing
some
fairly
simple
electrical
re-wiring
in
our
home
for
several
years
due
to
overall
hassle
and
cost
involved
.

i
finally
called
matt
from
bonafide
and
he
made
the
project
both
easy
for
us
and
reasonable
.

he
was
prompt
,
knowledgable
,
friendly
,
clean
and
just
an
overall
great
guy
who
obviously
cares
about
his
business
.

i
will
reccommend
his
services
however
/
whenever
possible
!

real
pros

i
've
had
writer
friends
describe
horror
stories
with
their
printers
.

i
tell
them
:
why
not
just
go
with
these
guys
?

richard
joule
and
the
gang
are
pros
from
start
to
finish
.

they
set
out
to
exceed
your
expectations
.

already
i
'm
considering
future
projects
,
and
i
can
assure
you
that
for
my
printing
needs
i
will
be
choosing
no
other
than
atlanta
paperback
book
printing
.

i
have
been
here
3
times
and
all
3
times
it
has
been
bad
!

they
have
messed
up
my
order
and
....
the
food
was
just
not
good
!

i
had
sonic
in
many
other
palces
but
for
some
reason
this
sonic
is
always
just
covered
in
grease
and
not
good
...
:(

i
hope
they
get
there
act
together
...

i
am
going
to
give
it
one
last
chance
in
next
few
months
and
see
??

i
called
them
for
an
estimate
and
they
insulted
me
when
i
ask
them
questions
.

they
are
very
rude
and
nasty
.

please
do
n't
use
this
moving
company
if
you
do
n't
want
to
:
cry
,
have
trouble
and
a
bad
experience
on
the
day
of
your
move
.

they
will
give
you
a
low
price
over
the
phone
and
on
the
day
of
your
move
they
will
change
the
price
,
i
guarantee
it
.

you
've
got
maids
did
a
fabulous
job
cleaning
my
home
.

i
am
hiring
them
to
come
once
a
week
now
that
they
got
my
house
to
where
they
can
maintain
it
for
only
an
hour
and
a
half
every
two
weeks
!

satisfactory
for
sure
with
the
sercvice
!

beats
having
one
"
cleaning
lady
"
who
took
twice
as
long
and
did
not
do
a
very
through
job
like
the
"
maids
"
did
!

this
place
has
the
best
baby
and
children
s
clothes
.

especially
high
end
keep
sake
sort
of
clothing
that
you
just
ca
nt
find
in
a
lot
of
stores
.

it
is
all
very
unique
and
you
wo
nt
find
any
other
baby
wearing
the
same
stuff
.

i
spent
quite
a
bit
because
i
spoil
my
little
princess
.

after
all
she
will
only
be
a
baby
for
so
long
i
figure
why
not
enjoy
it
.

great
place
for
antique
lighting
!

i
visited
their
huge
chicago
lighting
showroom
and
all
i
have
to
say
is
wow
!!

lots
of
collections
,
many
antique
light
fixtures
,
chandeliers
,
custom
lighting
etc
.

i
think
they
have
the
largest
collection
for
chandeliers
chicago
.

antiques
,
vintage
,
contemporary
&
modern
chandeliers
.

i
would
recommend
them
for
any
custom
lighting
or

repair
and
restoration
chicago

great
food
awesome
food
awesome
service

i
wanted
to
try
someplace
new
again
.

this
place
rocked
.

brought
my
wife
deb
with
me
and
she
like
the
fried
crab
wontons
and
said
they
were
good
..

we
also
had
the
bbq
spare
ribs
..
good
also
.

i
ordered
the
moo
shu
pork
and
it
was
great
..

i
also
ordered
the
neptune
platter
which
was
awesome
...
so
this
place
gets
5
out
of
5
stars
.

do
not
go
here
!!!

i
went
to
get
my
nails
filled
friday
,
by
monday
2
were
broken
.

i
was
not
happy
with
the
way
they
looked
,
very
wavy
,
uneven
edges
,
and
with
the
exception
of
1
,
there
is
a
dip
in
the
center
of
each
nail
.

i
also
had
a
pedicure
,
and
they
cut
my
nails
too
short
,
one
of
my
big
toes
looks
like
it
s
getting
infected
.

no
way
.

i
'm
certainly
no
expert
on
asian
food
in
fact
not
even
a
lover
of
vietnamese
food
but
i
wanted
to
try
the
real
things
here
at
a
dong
.

cold
,
slimy
,
tasteless
however
is
the
same
in
all
languages
and
foods
.

not
good
,
not
great
,
and
again
another
disappointment
in
central
iowa
.

how
do
these
places
stay
in
business
.

this
town
needs
some
food
soul
and
this
is
not
it
.

worth
every
penny

my
girlfriend
and
i
ate
at
the
grill
last
night
,
and
our
experience
was
amazing
.

everything
we
ordered
was
prepared
to
perfection
,
and
was
presented
perfectly
.

the
asparagus
,
seared
tuna
,
and
lobster
tail
were
the
best
we
ever
had
.

then
the
desserts
came
,
and
they
were
hands
down
the
best
dessert
we
ever
had
.

i
will
sum
it
up
with
,
it
was
worth
every
penny
!

best
chinese
restaurant
ever
!!!

it
was
the
best
chinese
food
i
have
ever
had
.

all
the
food
tasted
excellent
,
and
with
the
new
renovation
of
chairs
and
the
bathroom
,
it
is
awesome
.

the
people
working
their
are
also
extremely
polite
and
friendly
.

every
time
i
go
,
kevin
,
the
manager
,
will
always
remember
my
family
and
i
.

overall
,
it
is
very
family
oriented
,
and
i
recommend
it
to
everyone
!!!

nigel
from
nidd
design
has
always
provided
a
first
class
service
,
from
his
advice
and
professionalism
to
the
quality
of
his
design

he
really
does
turn
your
dreams
into
reality
for

we
came
at
around
730
and
they
close
at
8
and
wanted
to
try
the
specials
but
they
were
out
for
the
day
so
i
would
say
go
way
before
they
close
.

got
the
crab
rangoon
which
was
great
,
tofu
with
cabbage
which
was
spicy
but
good
and
shrimp
satay
which
was
also
good
.

def
going
to
come
back
and
try
this
place
again
.

bea
was
really
nice
and
asked
how
the
food
was
.

cute
place
also

as
a
native
southern
californian
i
can
tell
you
that
this
is
not
authentic
mexican
food
.

however
,
i
still
like
this
place
a
lot
.

esp.
the
mole
,
tortilla
soup
,
and
guacamole
.

margaritas
are
alright
.

my
only
complaint
is
the
queso
.

it
used
to
be
fabulous
,
why
did
you
guys
change
it
??

queso
should
not
be
watery
:(
.....

***
update
***
never
mind
!

they
fixed
the
queso
!

thank
you
thank
you

there
are
so
many

in
houston
....
do

waste
your
time
here
.

i
had
the
morelias
enchiladas
.

the
sauce
was
dry
and
the
enchiladas
did
not
taste
good
.
at
all
.

in
fact
my
friend
vomited
after
our
meal
.

maybe
we
ordered
the
wrong
dish
but
my
experience
here
was
poor
.

service
was
okay
not
great
,
we
came
for
a
late
lunch
.

i
do
n't
recommend
this
place

skylight
was
making
a
horrible
noise
when
the
wind
blew
.

james
bateman
came
the
day
i
called
and
fixed
the
problem
quickly
and
efficiently
.

he
also
inspected
my
entie
roof
to
see
if
there
was
anything
else
that
needed
attention
.

he
called
the
next
day
to
see
if
everything
was
to
my
satisfaction
.

when
the
next
hailstorm
blows
through
,
i
will
not
hesitate
to
contact
james

small
firm
with
great
service

bloom
legal
was
really
attentive
to
my
problem
,
and
seth
bloom
took
the
time
to
help
me
understand
the
legal
issue
i
was
dealing
with
.

i
much
preferred
the
one
-
on
-
one
service
here
to
the
experiences
i
've
had
with
bigger
offices
and
firms
.

while
i
hope
i
do
n't
have
any
need
for
a
lawyer
anytime
soon
,
if
i
do
i
'll
definitely
use
this
firm
again
.

used
their
service
for
the
first
time
and
was
immediately
impressed
by
their
professionalism
(
received
a
phone
call
soon
after
order
was
placed
to
confirm
details
)
and
the
subsequent
delivery
of
my
gift
(
to
split
,
croatia
)
was
as
requested
.

the
gift
itself
was
exactly
as
described
and
pictured
in
the
catalogue
and
of
the
highest
standard
.

would
highly
recommend
to
anyone
requiring
overseas
gift
delivery

i
love
my
gym
!

fitness
unlimited
is
a
second
home
to
a
lot
of
us
gym
members
who
work
out
daily
.

if
you
are
serious
about
working
out
in
a
non-commercial
like
atmosphere
then
you
have
chosen
the
best
place
to
be
.

this
is
the
most
humble
gym
you
will
every
step
into
....
if
you
dare
to
work
on
your
body
do
n't
be
surprised
when
you
see
how
addicting
going
to
fitness
unlimited
can
be
!!

over-rated
...

this
restaurant
is
over-rated
.

it
is
hard
to
find
...
and
the
mexican
food
is
bland
,
almost
equivalent
to
eating
out
of
a
can
.

the
service
is
poor
...

i
asked
for
a
fried
egg
on
my
enchiladas
...
and
did
not
get
it
.!

secondly
,
the
enchladas
did
not
come
with
enchilada
sauce
..
but
chili
...
like
hormel
's
chili
..
the
cheese
was
american
cheese
!

the
chili
relleno
..
had
no
batter
on
it
.

i
googled
restaurants
in
the
area
and
fuji
sushi
came
up
and
reviews
were
great
so
i
made
a
carry
out
order
of
:
l
17
.

mixed
tempura
.....................
8.25
shrimp
or
vegetable
tempura
&
salad
.

i
was
very
happy
with
the
customer
service
and
even
more
please
with
the
portion
size
,
to
go
box
set
up
and
quality
of
the
food
for
the
price
.

i
'm
very
happy
and
will
definitely
dine
in
and
carry
out
again
.

good
pizza
at
a
good
price

i
just
moved
nearby
and
have
tried
several
of
the
local
places
,
this
was
the
first
one
and
i
should
have
just
stuck
with
it
.

the
pizza
is
usually
pretty
good
,
the
only
bad
one
we
got
was
on
a
friday
night
and
it
just
needed
to
be
cooked
a
little
more
,
but
it
was
still
good
.

their
bbq
chicken
pizza
is
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
ever
had
.

horrible
service
!!!

absolute
horrible
service
from
the
parts
department
.

they
are
very
rude
over
the
phone
and
in
person
.

they
talk
down
to
you
like
they
are
supreme
beings
,
if
you
hate
your
job
so
much
then
quit
!!

how
these
guys
can
get
away
with
being
so
rude
with
people
is
mind
blowing
.

i
will
never
do
business
with
sun
toyota
again
.

thank
god
there
are
plenty
of
toyota
dealerships
to
choose
from
in
this
city
.

this
is
a
good
place

i
have
been
here
before
and
the
service
was
absoulutely
great
.

they
had
a
great
selection
of
colors
to
choose
from
and
their
seats
are
super
comfty
.

i
enjoy
going
there
although
i
've
only
been
there
once
,
i
will
be
returning
toda
to
recieve
a
pair
of
french
tips
and
i
will
only
go
to
the
best
and
to
me
the
best
is
here
.

i
reccomend
you
to
go
and
enjoy
their
wonderful
hospitality
.

anna
marie
and
govind
are
very
sweet
people
,
and
the
minute
you
steep
into
their
school
,
the
calm
loving
atmosphere
takes
over
,
and
tension
and
worries
stay
outside
in
the
street
,
whether
or
not
you
pick
them
up
again
after
class
is
probably
a
question
of
practice
.

a
wonderful
place
,
if
you
want
more
than
just
the
physical
side
of
yoga
.

give
yourself
the
gift
of
trying
this
place
,
to
see
if
it
fits
you
...

they
do
n't
seem
to
be
interested
in
selling
cars
.

went
there
yesterday
:
we
are
trying
to
decide
between
two
different
honda
models
,
so
we
wanted
to
test
-
drive
both
back
to
back
.

the
salesperson
refused
!

claimed
he
was
too
busy
for
two
test
drives
.

we
were
the
only
customers
there
!

do
n't
waste
time
,
just
drive
10
minutes
more
down
to
stevens
creek
,
they
actually
do
try
to
help
their
customers
there
!

ate
here
a
couple
times
.

it
is
not
a
high
end
steak
house
,
more
of
the
cuisine
brett
enjoys
in
mississippi
.

so
,
if
you
want
a
burger
and
fries
,
well
,
it
is
ok
.

if
you
want
a
little
cajunish
food
-
it
is
good
.

if
you
want
a
steak
,
well
,
this
is
not
the
best
in
green
bay
.

overall
decent
but
if
you
are
expecting
a
ruth
chris
type
steak
,
this
is
not
it
.

eulogic

good
place
to
be
on
a
sunday
night
.

the
beers
were
good
,
nice
choice
of
beers
as
well
,
and
as
usual
the
mussels
were
great
,
the
place
upstairs
is
a
nice
addition
to
the
bar
downstairs
.

filled
up
on
too
much
beer
and
hence
can
not
comment
on
the
food
.

but
the
menu
had
standard
stuff
that
one
would
get
at
a
belgian
tavern
.

if
you
are
a
handcraft
beer
person
,
this
is
a
fantastic
place
to
be
.

perfect
location
plus

i
moved
into
the
tanglewood
apartments
in
late
2008
and
it
's
been
a
refreshing
change
.

i
used
to
live
at
meadowrun
and
that
was
a
nightmare
.

the
manager
-
tiffany
-
is
actually
very
nice
so
i
'm
a
bit
surprised
by
other
comments
.

she
's
very
reachable
and
she
has
always
responded
quickly
to
any
questions
or
requests
.

plus
she
plans
a
monthly
breakfasts
and
other
events
at
the
clubhouse
which
is
a
nice
added
benefit
.

great
service
/
deals
-
support
this
local
business

i
have
used
these
guys
for
new
snows
,
fixing
lots
of
flats
,
used
replacement
tires
,
and
oil
changes
.

they
have
the
best
prices
locally
and
good
customer
service
.

one
guy
is
a
little
surley
,
but
who
gives
a
crap
as
long
as
your
car
's
work
is
outstanding
.

and
they
're
usually
able
to
help
you
as
a
walk
-
in
,
and
they
're
fast
.

overall
-
good
stuff
.

another
great
business
bites
the
dust
!

the
best
cakes
ever
!

a
bit
pricey
,
so
i
did
n't
go
very
often
,
but
it
was
always
a
treat
when
i
did
.

the
prices
were
worth
what
i
got
.

i
'm
assuming
they
are
completely
out
of
business
since
i
ca
n't
find
any
contact
information
.

i
'm
hoping
the
bakers
continue
to
do
their
baking
out
of
another
place
,
because
it
would
be
a
shame
not
to
have
these
cakes
any
longer
.

super
nice
people
,
really
good
food

what
i
love
most
about
this
place
,
other
than
the
food
,
is
that
eating
here
makes
you
feel
like
you
're
in
a
small
town
rather
than
baltimore
.

the
owners
are
really
nice
,
they
serve
good
food
at
a
good
price
,
and
the
option
to
eat
outside
on
the
deck
(
esp
on
the
weekend
whether
there
is
hardly
any
traffic
)
is
great
.

one
of
my
top
5
places
to
eat
in
baltimore
.

overpriced

this
place
is
identical
to
the
youngstown
sports
grille
,
so
i
imagine
they
are
owned
/
operated
by
the
same
people
.

the
food
is
mediocre
at
best
,
and
largely
overpriced
given
the
portion
size
and
quality
.

do
n't
even
get
me
started
on
how
expensive
it
is
to
drink
there
.

i
have
ate
here
3
times
since
they
first
opened
,
and
the
service
has
been
poor
each
time
,
the
staff
always
comes
across
as
somewhat
rude
and
slow
.

enjoyed
this
cozy
little
spot
with
a
group
of
8
folks
.

service
was
excellent
.

food
was
excellent
.

wine
was
excellent
.

i
was
feeling
the
need
for
some
fish
so
i
had
the
salmon
which
was
very
good
but
the
steaks
looked
amazing
and
if
i
am
in
town
again
,
i
'll
definitely
order
a
steak
.

a
perfect
place
for
a
romantic
dinner
.

lots
of
"
pretty
people
"
dining
inside
.

great
staff
.

very
helpful
!!!!

they
interviewed
me
,
gave
me
tests
in
the
software
i
included
on
my
resume
,
and
placed
me
in
a
position
that
i
kept
for
several
years
.

re-interviewed
and
am
going
on
interviews
for
a
new
job
.

i
'm
really
thankful
for
the
folks
at
hr
office
.

they
are
dependable
,
have
great
connections
in
the
community
,
and
are
a
great
resource
for
finding
a
job
.

i
highly
recommend
them
to
all
of
my
friends
!!!!
!

great
experience
-
consider
checking
out
their
puppies
before
buying
from
a
breeder
!

i
adopted
a
3.5
month
old
yellow
lab
last
winter
from
the
dumb
friends
league
.

the
staff
was
very
helpful
in
finding
the
right
dog
for
me
and
the
care
my
pup
received
was
outstanding
.

if
you
are
on
the
lookout
for
a
pure
breed
pup
do
n't
forget
to
check
out
the
shelters
!

my
pup
has
a
wonderful
temperment
and
has
been
a
wonderful
addition
to
my
family
!

food
good
,
service
poor

no
silverware
,
asked
for
a
spoon
for
my
son
s
mac
and
cheese
ended
up
having
to
use
my
tea
spoon
.

asked
for
bar
-
b
-
que
sauce
never
got
it
.

never
checked
back
with
us
once
we
got
our
food
.

had
to
go
the
the
bus
boy
s
station
ourselves
to
get
napkins
.

only
one
server
,
too
buys
talking
with
others
i
guess
.

food
was
good
,
but
service
means
a
lot
to
me
.

dr.
chao
you
are
the
best
dentist
i
have
ever
had
.

you
are
knowledgeable
,
professional
,
gentel
and
kind
.

i
wish
i
had
you
as
my
dentist
early
on
in
my
life
-
maybe
my
teeth
would
have
been
a
lot
better
then
they
are
now
,
however
i
am
glad
you
are
my
dentist
now
.

even
though
you
are
expensive
.

thank
you
for
helping
to
preserve
my
teeth
.

you
are
meticulous
in
your
work
and
it
shows
in
my
smile
.

con
garage

i
brought
my
car
in
for
a
simple
emissions
test
.

i
guess
they
figured
me
for
an
easy
mark
,
and
tried
to
explain
that
my
car
would
n't
pass
unless
i
replaced
a
hose
.

ten
minutes
later
,
i
took
my
car
down
the
street
and
it
passed
the
emissions
test
with
flying
colors
.

if
you
're
a
fan
of
herpes
,
being
ripped
off
,
and
child
molesters
,
this
is
the
garage
for
you
.

if
not
,
go
somewhere
else
.

rude
service

even
though
i
have
never
tried
hoa
salon
but
i
agree
with
other
reviewers
that
they
are
rude
.

i
called
and
asked
about
the
price
for
hair
updo
and
the
receptionist
or
owner
who
aswered
the
phone
refused
to
tell
me
,
or
even
just
give
me
an
approximate
price
range
.

he
told
us
to
stop
by
the
salon
and
then
he
will
tell
us
the
price
.

what
kind
of
rude
service
is
that
?

i
do
n't
want
to
waste
my
time
with
them
.

top
notch
eats
!

so
here
we
are
in
manson
.

manson
?

yes
,
manson
.

right
near
chelan
.

aka
nowheresville
.

and
this
litttle
gem
of
a
7
-
table
restaurant
is
a
complete
and
utterly
wonderful
surprise
.

a
short
but
wide
-
ranging
menu
executed
with
innovative
perfection
in
a
cozy
hole
in
the
wall
just
off
the
main
street
.

fantastic
food
served
without
pretense
,
very
reasonably
priced
wine
selections
.

a
great
place
to
go
for
dinner
after
a
day
of
wine
tasting
.

excellent
service
and
reasonable
prices

boutique
stores
dealing
in
children
's
clothing
/
gifts
are
often
outrageously
priced
(
who
wants
to
pay
40
dollars
for
a
newborn
onesie
?
)

but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
that
the
purple
goose
's
prices
are
reasonable
(
for
the
same
products
found
at
other
area
boutiques
,
the
prices
were
20
-
25
%
cheaper
)
.

the
service
was
also
excellent
-
friendly
,
helpful
and
informative
without
being
overbearing
.

will
definitely
return
.

consistantly
poor

a
lack
of
organisation
,
coupled
with
the
distain
for
its
customers
,
makes
this
the
worst
rental
agency
i
have
used
.

chasing
them
on
issues
from
the
day
i
moved
in
(
many
of
them
still
unresolved
as
i
left
)
to
all
sorts
of
farcical
issues
with
funds
,
after
i
left
.
.
.
.
as
soon
as
i
could
.

if
you
must
use
them
,
be
vigilant
and
be
ready
to
push
,
if
you
can
go
elsewhere
then
i
would
.

amazing
night
-
great
party
spot
!!

went
to
the
willow
lounge
this
past
weekend
for
dinner
and
drinks
...
place
is
awesome
.

had
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
a
/
c
broke
,
i
feel
bad
it
was
their
opening
!

anyway
,
once
that
is
fixed
,
this
place
will
be
amazing
.

drinks
were
awesome
,
prices
reasonable
,
and
staff
friendly
.

this
is
an
awesome
date
spot
that
the
area
seriously
needs
.

check
out
the
willow
lounge
,
you
ll
be
happy
!

it
s
been
a
few
years
since
i
have
been
to
ipanema
.

but
my
wife
and
i
first
went
there
thinking
it
would
be
brazilian
food
(
think
lots
of
meat
)
,
but
it
turned
out
to
be
a
vegan
restaurant
!

and
,
i
can
say
,
this
was
one
of
my
favorite
places
to
eat
in
all
of
richmond
.

amazing
!

do
n't
let
the
nondescript
building
entrance
fool
you
,
these
are
some
creative
and
talented
chefs
...
two
thumbs
way
,
way
up
!

excellent
food
,
fantastic
wait
staff

i
recently
threw
a
surprise
birthday
party
for
my
wife
at
fraiser
's
.

we
had
30
guests
for
the
event
,
and
everyone
came
away
from
the
evening
impressed
with
not
only
the
food
,
but
the
outstanding
service
as
well
.

the
management
was
easy
to
deal
with
during
the
planning
stages
,
and
the
execution
by
the
kitchen
and
wait
staff
was
flawless
.

i
highly
recommend
fraiser
's
for
anyone
planning
a
special
event
for
friends
,
family
or
business
.

fantastic
store
!!!

i
came
upon
this
store
as
the
building
caught
my
eye
.

it
's
located
in
the
huge
honka
log
homes
building
,
by
walmart
off
of
evergreen
parkway
.

the
store
was
decorated
with
furnishings
&
accessories
.

the
friendly
crew
working
was
great
&
very
helpful
.

this
store
is
what
colorado
is
all
about
.

also
,
i
purchased
some
furniture
last
year
and
all
has
been
great
!

it's
durability
&
look
was
perfect
and
i
will
definitely
be
adding
to
my
collection
soon
!

lovely
people
,
great
hats

i
was
saddened
to
see
the
reviews
that
claimed
world
hats
mart
has
poor
service
.

it
led
me
to
believe
that
the
reviewers
simply
had
difficulty
tolerating
people
with
strongly
-
accented
english
.

the
husband
and
wife
who
run
this
spot
are
lovely
people
.

we
have
had
many
conversations
with
them
and
they
have
always
been
extremely
patient
with
me
as
i
tried
on
multiple
hats
in
search
of
the
right
costumes
for
my
magic
act
.

i
recommend
them
highly
!

do
nt
ever
go
there
,
not
even
if
your
car
flips
.

their
service
sucks
to
start
off
with
,
people
are
cruel
and
ignorant
.

i
'm
compeltly
dissatisfied
with
their
service
and
their
products
.

they
do
not
have
a
return
policy
and
even
if
their
product
sucks
,
they
will
not
take
it
back
!

do
not
ever
go
here
.

i
prefer
advanced
auto
parts
over
this
crappy
place
with
the
meanest
people
.

and
they
thrive
to
get
a
customer
.

do
not
go
here
..
thank
you

horrible

i
have
been
growing
my
hair
out
for
1
year
plus
and
went
in
to
get
1
inch
taken
off
.

i
walked
out
with
5
inch
long
hair
on
the
top
,
2
inch
long
hair
on
the
sides
,
and
1.5
in
the
back
.

my
hair
is
uneven
and
it
looks
rediculous
.

this
woman
should
be
working
in
supercuts
...
if
that
.

this
was
a
terrible
experience
and
i
hope
that
no
one
else
goes
through
that
.

do
your
self
a
favor
and
do
not
go
to
this
establishment
.

the
worst
burger
king
restaurant
!!!

i
generally
like
the
bk
over
the
other
fast
serving
restaurants
;
however
,
i
regreted
to
visit
this
restaurant
at
my
town
.

this
is
a
shame
of
my
adorable
town
,
branford
.

i
ordered
a
kid
meal
with
a
milk
and
found
a
bottle
was
half
opened
already
.

i
asked
them
to
change
it
but
they
rudely
said
that
it
was
okay
.

disgusting
french
fries
is
very
best
menu
.

do
n't
go
,
or
you
will
learn
how
to
waste
your
money
.

disappointed

the
bad
:
i
was
at
napa
recently
and
was
unpleasantly
surprised
at
poor
waiter
svce
and
subpar
food
.

we
were
a
party
of
4
and
none
of
us
were
particularly
pleased
with
our
dishes
.

napa
is
all
about
wine
but
gives
very
short
descriptions
of
the
wines
on
their
lists
.

i
found
my
initial
selection
satisfactory
but
the
wine
flight
we
chose
to
be
poorly
composed
.

if
you
must
go
ask
lots
of
questions
about
your
selections
since
your
expectations
may
as
high
as
mine
were
.

highly
recommended

we
walked
in
to
pick
our
little
man
at
10
minutes
to
closing
and
heard
laughter
from
kids
and
the
staff
.

the
facilities
are
more
than
adequate
and
the
staff
are
just
phenomenal
.

their
sense
of
humour
and
calmness
when
dealing
with
the
little
ones
amazes
me
every
time
i
walk
in
.

we
have
since
moved
slightly
further
away
from
the
centre
but
it
's
worth
the
extra
travel
,
as
the
care
provided
exceeds
our
expectations
...
especially
after
a
few
horrendous
daycare
experiences
elsewhere
.

horrible
!!!!
!

this
has
to
be
some
of
the
worst
pizza
i
have
ever
had
the
misfortune
of
ordering
.

the
crust
was
lopsided
,
thicker
on
one
side
than
the
other
.

it
actually
had
a
hole
in
one
of
the
slices
.

there
was
minimal
cheese
and
sauce
and
it
completely
lacked
flavor
.

i
know
new
york
pizza
and
this
is
not
it
!!

this
was
nothing
like
new
york
style
pizza
!!!.

i
love
pizza
and
this
was
a
complete
and
utter
disappointment
!!

i
would
not
suggest
this
pizza
to
anyone
!!!

best
quote
ever
my
gate
was
stuck
halfway
open
so
i
called
a
class
garage
doors
dr
services
.

they
came
to
my
house
in
no
time
and
started
working
on
the
gate
.

they
were
very
friendly
and
were
able
to
explain
me
exactly
what
was
wrong
with
it
.

once
they
fixed
it
they
answetred
all
of
my
questions
with
no
hesitations
and
then
gave
me
the
best
quote
ever
.

i
know
that
if
my
garage
door
needs
to
be
repaired
,
i
will
be
calling
a
class
garage
doors

you
will
be
happy
at
this
store
!

allen
tire
was
recommended
by
friend
after
my
having
bad
tire
experiences
in
temecula
.

the
store
manager
,
jim
smith
,
made
an
excellent
tire
recommendation
for
my
newly
acquired
lexus
.

tires
were
the
right
price
and
now
the
car
feels
like
it
is
riding
on
rails
around
turns
.

the
store
is
clean
,
run
very
professionally
and
a
pleasure
to
be
in
.

they
know
their
job
and
you
do
not
have
to
watch
them
to
be
sure
everything
is
done
right
.

easiest
time
i
ever
had
purchasing
a
car
!

excellent
service
,
not
only
did
they
get
the
exact
car
i
wanted
win
in
48
hours
but
the
sales
man
also
took
me
out
to
lunch
.

very
kind
and
reliable
.

i
highly
recommend
this
dealership
if
you
would
not
like
to
hassle
on
price
and
receive
friendly
service
.

i
have
since
purchased
two
cars
from
this
dealership
,
the
first
one
was
from
phillip
and
the
second
was
from
richard
.

both
were
excellent
sales
men
who
put
my
needs
first
.

this
place
has
done
a
great
job
of
taking
care
of
the
usual
maintenance
on
my
hooptie
.

i
also
never
have
to
wait
long
for
a
yearly
inspection
sticker
...
and
never
get
the
usual
excuses
other
shops
always
gave
me
...
"
the
inspection
guy
is
n't
here
today
"
....
for
example
.

today
i
went
into
kwik
kar
and
there
were
two
cars
in
front
of
me
for
inspection
...
but
i
was
still
out
of
there
pretty
quick
...
barely
had
time
to
read
a
chapter
in
my
book
.

extremely
helpful
and
professional

as
first
-
time
home
buyers
,
my
husband
and
i
found
stephanie
fairchild
at
prudential
steamboat
realty
,
extremely
helpful
.

she
worked
with
us
for
over
a
year
,
helping
us
find
our
perfect
home
.

stephanie
's
knowledge
of
the
market
and
properties
in
our
price
range
,
made
us
feel
secure
in
our
decision
to
buy
when
we
did
.

we
would
highly
recommend
stephanie
to
anyone
looking
for
a
home
in
the
yampa
valley
.

we
appreciated
her
patience
,
knowledge
and
kindness
!

great
barber

firstly
,
the
other
reviewer
clearly
has
never
been
to
nick
's
,
or
he
would
know
that
nick
only
charges
$
13
for
a
haircut
which
is
pretty
much
industry
standard
.

i
have
been
going
to
nick
for
5
months
now
precisely
because
he
does
pay
attention
to
detail
.

i
have
terrible
hair
and
he
really
takes
his
time
to
make
it
look
right
.

some
of
the
younger
kids
that
work
there
are
a
bit
sub
par
,
but
if
you
wait
for
nick
...
you
'll
be
good
.

ugh
!!!

got
some
nice
"
freshly
baked
"
fruit
squares
,
a
personal
favorite
of
mine
.

took
a
bite
,
it
tasted
odd
.

flipped
the
square
over
and
saw
it
riddled
with
green
mold
!!!!

ugh
!!

i
called
the
store
and
the
clerk
giggled
,
and
agreed
that
it
was
gross
,
but
said
it
was
not
her
problem
.

she
also
refused
to
get
a
manager
.

i
left
my
number
,
or
tried
to
anyway
.

same
clerk
had
considerable
difficulty
taking
down
a
number
.

i
'll
never
go
back
there
again

for
cheap
chinese
food
,
this
is
the
place
to
go
.

i
used
to
eat
at
places
like
new
china
or
green
buffet
in
troy
,
mo
-
nothing
terrible
but
not
that
great
.

now
,
i
wo
n't
eat
fast
food
chinese
unless
it
's
from
this
place
.

the
best
value
i
've
found
from
a
chinese
restaurant
.

i
do
n't
live
in
lake
st.
louis
anymore
,
but
deliveries
were
always
correct
and
the
service
courteous
.

now
i
have
to
be
in
the
area
to
get
some
lovin'
:
sad
face
:

amazing
experience
!

my
experience
was
amazing
at
providence
aesthetics
and
medical
spa
.

jana
kueck
was
nothing
but
professional
.

she
makes
you
feel
like
you
are
the
most
important
person
in
the
world
.

jana
made
me
feel
very
comfortable
.

provided
me
with
warm
blanket
and
has
soft
music
playing
.

walking
in
the
door
you
are
made
to
feel
happy
and
relaxed
.

equipment
is
state
of
the
art
.

i
would
reccomend
anyone
to
go
see
jana
kueck
and
robin
talley
to
see
all
the
many
procedures
they
have
to
offer
.

dave
is
a
patient
and
methodical
teacher
,
who
has
a
great
ear
and
sensitivity
for
his
students
'
passion
and
the
direction
they
want
their
lessons
to
take
.

also
,
he
loves
teaching
so
much
,
his
price
is
unbeatable
,
but
that
does
not
change
his
level
of
skill
.

dave
has
much
to
offer
.

in
just
2
-
3
focused
lessons
,
i
'm
already
now
capable
of
picking
up
new
songs
off
youtube
guitar
how
to
videos
and
am
even
writing
my
own
orginals
with
confidence
!

we
love
our
new
roof
!

we
would
like
to
thank
you
for
the
roofing
job
you
did
on
our
home
.

everything
was
done
on
a
timely
manner
and
things
were
cleaned
and
picked
up
every
day
when
the
crew
was
done
.

we
also
liked
the
way
that
ray
checked
on
the
job
every
day
.

and
when
the
job
was
done
every
thing
was
cleaned
up
and
hauled
off
that
same
day
.

we
would
not
hesitate
to
use
spears
roofing
again
.

we
have
already
recommended
you
to
some
of
our
friends
!

omfg

i
fucking
hate
this
place
every
time
i
go
this
hot
chick
shows
up
and
i
mean
really
hot
but
she
is
like
reaaaally
dumb
and
then
their
is
this
other
chick
that
is
realy
ugly
but
she
is
like
super
smart
she
could
be
a
scientist
,
but
then
their
is
this
stoner
who
always
comes
here
high
and
he
always
brings
his
fucking
dog
who
is
so
high
from
the
second
hand
smoke
i
think
he
is
trying
to
talk
.

anyway
we
drive
around
in
my
van
and
solve
mysterys
and
shit

amazingly
yummy
!

i
just
got
back
from
france
yesterday
and
just
missed
the
food
already
!

my
sister
in
law
told
me
about
this
amazing
new
crepe
place
in
town
,
i
was
so
excited
i
just
wanted
to
go
and
test
it
out
for
my
self
!

their
customer
service
was
perfect
!

their
food
was
better
then
anything
i
had
ever
tasted
.

even
in
france
!

i
would
highly
recommend
this
place
to
anyone
looking
for
a
great
atmosphere
,
amazing
food
,
and
great
customer
service
!

thank
you
roll
up
crepes
!

this
is
one
of
the
worst
places
i
have
stayed
,
we
cut
out
stay
short
and
went
to
the
mulberry
.

even
though
they
still
charge
you
the
days
you
booked
but
wo
n't
use
,
it
is
worth
the
get
the
hell
out
of
this
crap
hole
.

the
whole
experience
shows
a
hotel
managed
by
what
must
be
a
2
star
hotel
manager
.

bad
service
starting
from
the
front
desk
.

the
best
person
is
the
valet
.

short
of
that
,
avoid
this
place
,
as
a
silver
marriott
member
,
this
is
a
disgrace
.

best
place
in
ames

i
lived
here
for
two
years
when
the
prices
were
a
little
lower
:)
the
places
are
very
nice
and
clean
,
and
in
great
condition
!

i
really
enjoyed
the
staff
at
wessex
,
also
the
manager
sherri
was
always
very
nice
and
helpful
.

the
fitness
center
was
great
!

the
only
problem
that
i
had
in
2
years
of
living
there
was
that
the
walls
are
pretty
thin
,
sometimes
i
could
here
my
neighbors
conversations
.

i
would
recommend
these
apartments
to
anybody
!

i
absolutely
loved
living
there
.

the
best
service
ever
!!

i
have
never
had
better
service
.

my
car
broke
down
and
roadside
towed
my
vehicle
to
sussman
kia
.

they
squeezed
me
in
and
had
me
back
up
and
running
in
no
time
.

everyone
was
pleasant
and
very
helpful
.

the
service
department
even
gave
me
a
ride
home
and
picked
me
up
when
my
car
was
finished
.

the
advisor
kept
me
up
to
date
and
informed
on
the
progress
of
my
vehicle
.

i
give
this
dealer
an
a
+
!

i
will
definitely
be
bringing
my
car
back
for
service
.

heaven
on
earthhhhhhh

place

friendly
,
fine
food

the
one
-
star
review
from
2005
is
out
of
date
.

there
was
a
change
of
ownership
a
couple
of
years
ago
and
service
is
both
quick
and
extremely
friendly
.

the
food
continues
to
be
very
good
--
deli
sandwiches
,
homemade
soups
,
fresh
salads
.

the
atmosphere
may
not
be
for
everyone
.

it
is
a
bustling
place
where
separate
parties
are
seated
at
the
same
table
(
as
in
many
european
cafes
)
,
but
if
you
are
ok
with
that
,
the
food
is
very
good
.

love
the
soups
.

do
we
need
another
one
?

only
if
it
is
of
the
quality
of
that
's
amore
.

the
menu
has
the
usual
but
then
they
step
it
up
another
notch
.

the
arancini
di
riso
(
risotto
fritters
)
are
not
to
be
missed
.

chicken
saltimboca
was
excellent
and
then
there
's
the
chocolate
mousse
that
comes
straight
from
heaven
.

pay
extra
attention
to
the
appetizers
-
the
next
time
i
go
there
i
'm
planning
on
ordered
a
few
instead
of
an
entree
.

auto
towing
is
one
of
the
best
towing
services
i
have
used
.

the
first
time
i
used
them
they
arrived
on
time
and
towed
car
for
me
to
the
destination

needed

the
auto
mechanics
that
work
for
auto
towing
are
very
friendly
and
informative
and
answered
any
question
i
had
.

they
have
towed
car
for
me
a
few
times
and
i
am
always
very
satisfied
with

services
.

offer
you
a
good
towed
car
service

a
very
satisfied
new
customer
!

as
a
very
satisfied
new
customer
,
i
wholeheartedly
recommend
united
air
duct
cleaning
.

they
are
professional
,
knowledgeable
,
and
take
meticulous
care
and
pride
in
accomplishing
their
work
.

not
only
were
my
wife
and
i
very
pleased
,
but
i
also
had
the
air
duct
quality
tested
professionally
by
the
home
inspector
that
i
regularly
use
,
before
and
after
united
air
duct
performed
their
work
.

based
on
the
test
results
,
the
home
inspector
stated
that
the
quality
of
their
job
was
"
excellent
"
.

the
best
breakfast
in
solana
beach
!

we
love
t
's
cafe
!

without
a
doubt
the
best
place
to
grab
a
tall
bloody
mary
and
some
eggs
benedict
.

t
's
has
been
a
north
county
landmark
for
thirty
years
and
with
good
reason
.

family
owned
and
operated
makes
sure
the
atmosphere
is
relaxed
and
the
food
home
-
cooked
with
style
.

i
highly
recommend
picking
up
a
jug
of
their
homemade
bloody
mary
mix
-
definitely
the
best
.

if
you
've
been
to
north
county
,
chances
are
it
's
in
your
favorites
list
already

prominent

prominent
builders
in
new
jersey
are
one
the
best
building
contractors
,
i
was
referred
to
them
by
my
friend
,
i
am
so
glad
i
used
them
for
my
home
renovation
,
and
addition
.

they
were
very
professional
,
respectful
,
completed
the
job
on
time
,
and
well
below
my
budget
.

mike
one
of
owners
was
awesome
,
he
explained
the
detailed
plan
,
and
executed
on
time
,
i
am
always
going
use
them
and
refer
them
to
many
friends
i
can
because
of
the
great
job
they
did
me
.

great
dude
cut
!

great
service
,
cool
vibe
,
impeccable
style
.

i
'm
a
guy
with
tricky
hair
so
getting
that
right
is
job
1
.

after
going
through
5
other
places
i
finally
found
janice
at
alta
moda
.

not
only
was
it
a
good
cut
but
my
wife
and
friends
comment
on
my
hair
every
time
i
leave
...
saying
it
's
the
best
look
i
've
ever
had
.

either
i
suck
at
my
own
style
or
janice
is
a
genius
.

looks
like
there
's
a
lot
of
talent
in
this
place
.

worth
every
penny
.

my
favorite
place
at
wildwood

i
have
been
going
to
the
wildwood
,
nj
for
over
30
years
for
summer
vacations
and
always
call
the
madrid
first
.

i
rated
it
5
stars
.

i
am
not
saying
it
is
a
5
star
hotel
.

i
am
saying
when
comparing
all
other
hotels
in
wildwood
,
this
hotel
has
everything
that
we
are
looking
for
.

it
is
the
hospitality
from
tom
and
staff
,
that
makes
it
feel
like
a
5
star
hotel
in
the
middle
of
the
beach
.

we
prefer
the
layout
of
rooms
and
it
is
always
clean
.

when
in
scordia
,
sicily

if
ever
in
sicily
please
take
the
time
to
visit
anna
maria
jose
mudo
and
her
familia
.

they
are
and
always
will
be
the
nicest
people
in
sicily
that
you
will
meet
.

you
will
also
have
the
pleasure
of
learning
the
italiano
language
.

you
will
also
have
the
experience
of
learning
the
bella
sicilian
culture
,
that
i
have
fallen
in
luv
with
.

i
will
4
-
ever
be
eternally
grateful
for
their
hospitality
and
luv
that
my
sicilian
family
showed
me
when
i
was
there
for
3
years
.

luv
always
..

i
've
never
felt
the
need
to
write
a
review
or
make
a
complaint
before
,
but
after
the
way
i
was
spoken
to
by
a
member
of
staff
at
the
kennels
(
whose
name
i
believe
to
be
mrs
closs
)
i
would
now
not
recommend
this
business
to
anybody
.

if
the
animals
are
treated
in
the
same
way
the
customers
are
treated
then
this
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
!

nobody
should
be
spoken
to
like
that
regardless
of
how
bad
their
day
may
have
been
or
what
may
be
going
on
in
their
private
lives
!

best
car
dealer
in
tx

i
purchased
a
nissan
from
this
dealship
.

the
sales
men
were
very
knowledgeable
about
every
aspect
of
every
car
we
looked
at
.

they
were
very
patient
and
helpful
from
showing
the
cars
to
doing
the
paperwork
.

the
paperwork
was
a
very
easy
and
smooth
.

they
tried
to
run
my
credit
score
as
less
as
possible
so
it
wo
n't
hurt
my
score
.

overall
,
i
was
very
happy
with
the
customer
service
and
my
purchase
.

if
you
're
looking
to
buy
a
car
,
definitely
give
them
a
call
.

they
have
a
huge
inventory
.

i
have
been
a
patient
a
nw
hospital
and
it
was
great
.

i
have
also
had
an
80
yr
old
that
i
take
of
sent
to
the
er
and
long
stays
in
the
hospital
.

yes
,
we
had
to
wait
,
but
er
is
a
triage
system
that
takes
the
most
life
threatening
cases
first
.

any
er
would
be
the
same
.

as
far
as
being
treated
like
a
drug
seeker
,
that
has
not
been
my
experience
.

as
a
nurse
i
know
about
drug
seekers
.

this
is
a
great
hospital
and
even
better
since
it
became
part
of
the
uw
system
.

wonderful
experience

i
had
immense
pain
on
a
sunday
morning
,
with
friends
and
family
telling
me
that
i
would
never
find
a
dentist
on
a
sunday
.

dr.
taylor
was
not
only
available
on
a
sunday
,
but
also
was
able
to
immediately
take
care
of
me
.

he
was
incredibly
informative
about
the
options
i
had
,
giving
me
opinions
on
different
treatments
to
choose
from
.

coming
from
a
person
who
hates
the
dentist
in
general
,
dr.
taylor
was
the
best
!

he
really
made
the
visit
a
pain
free
one
with
excellent
service
!

i
would
recommend
him
to
everyone
!

horrible

this
school
is
the
worst
one
i
've
ever
been
to
.

i
attended
it
for
2
years
,
and
that
was
enough
.

there
's
holes
everywhere
in
the
ceiling
,
sewage
constantly
leaks
through
the
ceiling
,
and
the
whole
condition
of
the
school
is
horrible
.

the
staff
and
the
principal
are
rediculous
,
they
do
n't
listen
to
any
input
,
and
they
make
up
rediculous
rules
(
they
banned
backpacks
,
because
a
teacher
tripped
over
a
student
's
)
.

the
education
is
horrible
at
best
,
do
society
a
favor
,
and
do
not
send
your
student
here
.

excellent
customer
service
and
quality
work
.

they
went
the
extra
mile
to
repair
my
cowboy
boots
--
they
had
to
have
a
special
kind
of
paper
that
looked
like
wood
grain
to
fix
the
heels
.

that
was
4
years
ago
.

i
have
n't
been
able
to
find
a
shoe
repair
place
in
seattle
since
that
has
been
able
to
do
it
.

(
i
've
been
through
at
least
5
places
already
.
)

if
i
had
time
to
drive
to
tacoma
before
they
closed
during
the
work
week
,
i
would
just
so
i
could
get
those
boots
fixed
properly
again
.

so
handy
for
local
la
jolla
stuff
-
especially
for
finding
residential
numbers

since
moving
back
from
college
and
trying
to
settle
roots
in
the
village
,
i
have
referred
to
the
la
jolla
blue
book
for
a
ton
of
local
numbers
.

the
white
pages
allowed
me
to
get
in
touch
with
parents
of
my
high
school
friends
so
that
i
could
track
people
down
one
by
one
and
the
restaurant
section
is
basically
my
cookbook
.

it
's
really
cool
that
so
many
local
businesses
are
found
so
quickly
in
one
place
and
i
want
to
spread
the
word
.

thx
:-)

the
staff
do
occasionally
get
game
info
correct
,
but
if
you
r
looking
fot
a
good
game
and
are
n't
a
nerd
,
do
nt
ask
them
.

the
last
time
i
did
that
i
was
suggested
to
buy
oblivion
when
i
told
them
i
was
looking
for
a
fps
.

i
knew
what
it
was
and
told
the
guy
that
it
was
n't
a
fps
.

he
tried
to
tell
me
it
was
when
i
told
asked
him
if
he
knew
what
fps
stood
for
and
he
had
no
clue
.

overall
they
are
n't
very
knowledge
about
the
type
of
games
are
on
the
market
.

first
and
last
time
we
'll
eat
there

my
friend
and
i
went
there
for
lunch
today
.

neither
one
of
us
had
ever
been
-
so
we
thought
we
'd
try
it
.

big
mistake
-
the
food
was
tasteless
and
cold
.

we
both
kept
trying
to
find
something
we
liked
.

the
only
thing
i
found
edible
were
the
potato
wedges
,
i
finally
gave
up
,
he
kept
trying
-
he
found
the
fried
wantons
to
be
ok
-
his
mongolian
bowl
was
awful
.

would
not
recommend
this
place
to
anyone
-
in
fact
-
save
your
money
and
go
somewhere
else
.

liquidweb.com
rocks
!!!

i
am
not
a
client
of
liquidweb.com
,
but
one
of
my
friend
called
steven
is
the
client
having
several
websites
.

i
work
with
him
and
since
past
6
years
he
is
hosting
his
websites
to
liquidweb
.

as
i
have
gone
through
many
reviews
sites
to
see
if
any
provider
is
providing
better
services
or
not
,
and
i
have
realized
that
there
were
many
good
reviews
about
liquidweb
also
steven
never
faced
any
server
issues
in
his
whole
hosting
.

the
kind
of
support
they
provide
is
simply
great
!!!

i
would
like
to
host
my
upcoming
website
to
liquidweb.com

simple

perfect

if
you
want
flashy
fancy
food
stacked
high
with
lots
of
fussy
garnishes
,
this
is
not
the
place
for
you
.

if
you

perfectly
executed
simple
dishes
that
feature
a
few
exquisite
ingredients
,
you
'll
love

hands
-
down
the
best
pasta
and
gnocchi
i
've
ever
eaten
(
and
i
've
eaten
a
lot
)
.

the
antipasti
were
amazing
,
the
wines
were
mind
-
blowing
,
the
service
could
n't
have
been
better
.

i
've
dined
at
lots
of
high
-
end
restaurants
and
i
've
never
before
felt
my
money
was
so
well
spent
.

great
prices
,
great
service
!

i
've
been
to
this
shop
twice
(
once
for
an
inspection
and
again
for
an
oil
change
)
and
they
truly
live
up
to
their
name
:
discount
!

they
have
all
kind
of
coupons
available
for
car
washes
,
oil
changes
,
state
inspection
,
etc
.

the
thing
is
,
you
still
get
high
quality
service
at
nicely
discounted
rates
!

there
is
even
free
coffee
and
bottles
of
water
if
you
'd
like
.

the
owner
is
a
pleasant
guy
and
i
would
trust
my
car
with
him
or
any
of
his
workers
.

top
notch
,
all
the
way
!

david
is
amazing

david
is
the
most
helpful
and
creative
photographer
that
i
have
used
.

he
is
willing
to
do
whatever
you
need
from
him
without
hesitation
.

he
was
patient
and
adapted
when
everything
did
n't
go
according
to
schedule
on
my
wedding
day
.

both
the
engagement
and
wedding
pictures
that
he
took
for
us
we
absolutely
amazing
.

he
got
the
pictures
back
to
me
quickly
.

i
would
highly
recommend
david
to
anyone
.

he
will
exceed
your
expectations
!

he
does
n't
just
take
pictures
he
makes
art
out
of
them
and
you
wo
n't
even
notice
that
there
's
a
camera
there
.

not
so
great

my
husband
just
got
a
bike
there
as
a
gift
he
's
only
had
it
a
month
.

it
's
a
nice
bike
and
it
cost
a
lot
of
money
.

but
just
this
week
a
peddle
broke
.

he
took
it
back
and
they
would
not
honor
a
warranty
and
said
it
was
his
fault
because
of
his
shoes
??

so
they
were
going
to
charge
him
for
new
peddles
and
proceeded
to
put
them
on
without
even
telling
him
the
price
.

which
was
very
expensive
.

he
asked
for
a
different
pair
instead
and
they
only
gave
him
five
dollars
off
??

trek
is
not
so
great

only
concerned
with
money

i
have
been
getting
my
treatments
for
a
few
months
now
and
have
seen
some
results
but
not
up
to
the
standards
that
i
was
told
i
should
expect
.

the
people
there
attempt
to
come
across
and
professional
and
nice
,
but
i
was
disappointed
with
their
customer
service
.

never
miss
an
appointment
because
they
will
charge
you
the
price
of
a
treatment
,
even
if
you
had
an
emergency
.

it
's
pretty
ridiculous
!

they
want
to
squeeze
as
much
as
they
can
from
you
even
if
you
just
got
in
a
car
accident
!!!!

they
do
n't
care
one
bit
about
you
!!!!!

terrible
service
!!!

made
an
appointment
to
have
them
come
to
the
house
to
discuss
curtain
options
and
give
an
estimate
.

they
sent
over
someone
who
said
he
knows
nothing
about
curtains
and
could
not
show
me
fabric
options
or
give
an
estimate
.

when
i
called
the
manager
to
complain
,
she
said
she
knew
the
guy
did
n't
know
about
curtains
and
that
the
usual
lady
called
in
sick
hours
earlier
!

instead
of
rescheduling
they
chose
to
waste
my
time
instead
.

so
what
was
the
point
of
the
appointment
!?!

to
just
come
over
and
hang
out
?!?

i
will
never
do
business
with
this
company
!

ever
!!!

internet
department
is
rude
and
insulting

i
was
looking
to
bring
a
customer
to
their
lot
to
buy
a
car
but
the
internet
salesperson
last
name
is
balazick
sent
me
this
email
"
and
if
it
was
worth
my
time
i
would
of
bothered
aswering
your
questions
.

i
make
money
not
deal
with
brokers
"
wow
,
can
you
believe
in
today
s
tough
times
this
dealership
would
be
looking
for
any
way
to
move
vehicles
.

as
a
previous
internet
manager
i
would
deal
with
anyone
looking
to
buy
a
car
for
a
profit
and
not
care
if
they
came
in
with
a
broker
.

stay
away
from
this
dealership
!!!

this
place
is
a
rip
-
off

i
brought
a
car
in
to
have
the
"
check
engine
"
light
diagnosed
back
in
march
of
2010
.

they
said
it
was
"
plugs
and
wires
"
and
quoted
me
$
330
to
do
the
work
,
including
parts
.

i
asked
why
so
high
and
they
said
it
was
due
to
the
labor
of
moving
things
out
of
the
way
.

those
things
ended
up
being
a
windsheild
washer
fluid
tank
(
1
screw
)
and
the
air
filter
canister
(
4
spring
clips
)
.

i
did
the
work
myself
for
$
50
.

there
's
no
excuse
for
that
kind
of
estimate
.

my
girlfriend
and
i
took
a
chance
on
this
place
because
we
did
n't
want
to
wait
in
line
at
outback
.

what
an
amazing
find
-
this
restaurant
is
a
gem
.

1
it
s
immaculately
clean
.

2
the
decor
is
tasteful
and
artistic
,
from
the
comfortable
chairs
to
the
elegant
light
fixtures
....
and
(
most
importantly
)
3
the
food
is
fantastic
.

this
is
authentic
cuban
cuisine
;
fresh
ingredients
expertly
prepared
and
seasoned
perfectly
.

the
portions
were
generous
and
we
got
out
for
less
than
the
cost
of
one
entree
at
some
chain
restaurant
.

try
this
place
-
you
'll
love
it
.

thank
you
for
helping
me
get
more
healthy
!

i
came
in
and
saw
dr.
ruona
about
a
month
ago
for
quitting
smoking
.

i
have
to
tell
you
that
i
have
n't
had
one
and
do
n't
want
one
.

it
is
the
easiest
thing
that
i
have
ever
done
and
i
tell
all
my
friends
that
they
should
do
it
too
.

i
sent
a
customer
of
mine
to
you
.

dr.
ruona
,
if
you
read
this
,
thank
you
for
helping
me
get
more
healthy
.

i
feel
lighter
and
feel
that
i
have
more
possibilities
open
to
me
now
than
i
did
before
.

i
ca
n't
thank
you
enough

fantastic
for
kids

if
you
have
children
or
are
just
a
real
animal
lover
yourself
you
'll
love
this
zoo
.

it
's
only
$
10
and
in
essence
just
one
big
petting
zoo
.

they
sell
feed
and
milk
bottles
at
the
front
and
i
recommend
you
buy
lots
.

we
took
our
7
month
old
and
she
laughed
and
giggled
when
(
very
harshly
i
might
add
)
grabbing
and
'
kissed
'
the
goats
and
lambs
.

the
animals
were
all
very
sweet
and
patient
with
her
.

among
the
animals
that
were
available
to
touch
were
pony's
,
camels
and
even
an
ostrich
!!!

wonderful
,
inexpensive
and
lots
of
fun
!

wow
!!!

i
ca
n't
say
enough
good
things
about
karla
and
the
wonderful
things
she
has
done
for
me
and
my
dog
gracee
.

gracee
is
more
excited
to
see
her
than
she
is
to
see
me
!!!!

she
has
always
been
there
for
gracee
even
for
last
minute
calls
!

she
has
taken
care
of
my
sweet
girl
for
almost
4
years
now
and
i
would
not
let
gracee
go
with
anyone
besides
her
!!!

she
is
caring
,
punctual
,
and
very
enthusiastic
about
her
job
!

you
should
give
her
a
try
-
it
's
worth
every
penny
to
know
that
you
pet
is
in
great
hands
with
wunderbar
pet
sitting
!!!!

worst
service
i
've
ever
experienced

i
wish
there
was
something
good
to
say
about
the
business
,
but
unfortunately
,
there
is
n't
.

1
)
service
and
manners
were
nonexistent
.

2
)
the
employees
constantly
talk
down
to
customers
and
are
very
argumentative
for
the
sake
of
being
argumentative
.

(
to
both
myself
and
customers
)
3
)
i
have
never
experienced
so
much
rudeness
coming
from
a
business
.

4
)
the
business
is
very
unorganized
.

the
invoice
is
not
detailed
,
so
it
is
difficult
to
see
what
you
are
paying
for
.

i
'd
recommend
to
save
your
time
and
energy
and
find
another
greek
store
.

exile
is
the
best
!!!

exile
is
the
longest
lasting
and
most
authentic
punk
store
in
richmond
!

i
have
been
shopping
there
for
over
six
years
now
.

the
staff
is
incredibly
friendly
and
helpful
and
the
owner
,
mimmy
,
is
an
absolute
angel
.

the
mark
up
is
minimal
considering
that
the
clothing
is
hard
to
find
and
often
shipped
for
europe
.

in
addition
,
the
clothing
is
of
much
better
quality
than
the
clothing
from
hot
topic
,
which
is
made
as
cheaply
as
possible
by
people
living
in
horrible
conditions
in
asia
.

exile
is
environmentally
conscious
and
involved
heavily
in
our
community
.

over-rated

buddakan
inevitably
attracts
the
majority
of
its
guests
simply
because
of
its
association
with
steven
starr
,
but
that
does
n't
impress
me
.

the
atmosphere
alone
deserves
4
stars
but
,
the
food
was
not
up
to
par
with
the
price
tag
and
the
reputation
the
restaurant
carries
.

the
server
we
had
was
knowledgeable
but
he
was
not
as
proper
as
he
should
have
been
,
acting
like
he
was
talking
to
his
friends
rather
than
his
customers
.

the
angry
lobster
was
completely
over-priced
!

$
80
for
a
dish
that
has
about
one
small
lobster
tail
and
is
full
of
filler
vegetables
!

i
would
n't
go
there
again
.

alto
delivers
on
all
levels
.

from
the
moment
you
enter
the
restaurant
,
you
know
you
are
some
place
special
.

the
service
is
impeccable
,
and
the
food
is
even
better
.

i
highly
recommend
the
four
-
course
tasting
menu
,
which
gives
you
plenty
of
range
and
food
to
satisfy
your
appetite
.

also
,
if
you
are
into
wine
,
alto
has
the
depth
of
both
region
,
varietal
,
and
vintage
to
satisfy
nearly
any
sommelier
(
or
after
9
pm
,
bring
your
own
bottle
for
free
...
no
corking
fee
!
)
.

while
it
's
not
cheap
,
alto
will
give
you
an
experience
you
'll
never
forget
.

the
landlord
is
not
nice
nor
helpful

i
have
lived
in
buckingham
condominiums
townhouse
for
2
years
.

i
love
the
location
and
the
apartment
!!

i
'm
a
single
female
and
i
feel
safe
coming
home
at
night
.

the
maintenance
people
are
awesome
!!!!

and
the
exterminator
is
very
nice
,
also
.

yes
,
you
still
have
a
few
bugs
,
but
that
's
going
to
be
anywhere
you
go
!

the
only
problem
that
i
have
experienced
is
the
landlord
.

she
is
a
pure
b****
!!!

i
know
that
's
ugly
...
but
she
wo
n't
help
you
out
for
anything
...
sad
story
.

other
than
that
,
i
would
recommend
living
here
.
:)

the
staff
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
.

the
front
staff
has
seen
quite
a
bit
of
turnover
and
changed
from
professional
to
rude
.

a
simple
follow
-
up
phone
call
with
a
woman
quickly
turned
into
a
nightmare
.

she
may
be
the
reason
for
all
the
change
.

i
sincerely
wonder
if
the
doctor
has
a
clue
about
what
is
going
on
within
his
practice
.

if
he
does
know
and
approves
of
this
behavior
then
it
is
a
poor
reflection
on
him
.

sometimes
it
is
not
worth
it
to
go
through
that
kind
of
staff
and
their
personal
attitude
to
get
to
a
doctor
.

he
was
an
okay
doctor
but
not
worth
her
.

-
wonderful
wild
wildernest
inn

i
would
give
the
wildernest
inn
ten
stars
of
five
!

atop
spring
mountain
,
from
the
decks
of
the
west
porch
,
"
one
can
see
forever
"
a
scene
of
unparalleled
beauty
and
grandeur
.

i
saw
deer
frequently
,
in
fact
a
small
herd
were
grazing
near
the
lodge
.

there
were
occasional
bears
on
the
deck
in
the
morning
.

and
most
correctly
,
us
visitors
did
not
mingle
with
the
native
wildlife
.

it
would
have
been
more
than
one
could
bear
!

kathy
and
stewart
,
the
proprietors
were
the
epitome
of
perfection
.

delightful
,
hospitable
,
superb
,
cozy
and
comfortable
.

i
hope
to
be
back
!

junkie
lube
?!

really
weird
place
,
i
was
driving
home
from
work
thought
i
'd
stop
in
for
an
oil
change
and
well
,
there
are
a
few
guys
in
jiffy
lube
uniforms
sitting
at
the
table
drinking
beers
and
shooting
the
breeze
.

the
neon
lighting
sign
still
said
"
on
"
yet
some
guy
who
seemed
to
be
the
oldest
of
the
bunch
,
more
like
the
drunkest
of
the
bunch
told
me
they
'd
be
open
tomorrow
.

i
asked
if
a
manager
was
on
duty
he
told
me
he
was
.

wow
!

grey
shirt
"
mark
"
of
course
with
this
type
behavior
he
could
have
been
wearing
someon
else
s
clothing
.....

a
friend
and
i
recently
took
our
16
and
18
month
olds
here
.

while
there
was
n't
too
much
available
for
their
age
(
ball
pit
,
bouncy
area
and
a
little
padded
pyramid
to
climb
on
)
,
we
went
right
when
they
opened
at
10
am
on
a
winter
weekday
and
ended
up
being
the
only
ones
there
,
so
we
were
given
a
little
more
liberty
than
we
would
have
if
others
had
been
there
.

it
's
not
the
classiest
place
,
but
it
was
cleaner
than
i
expected
and
the
staff
was
very
friendly
.

for
$
4
it
was
a
nice
break
from
the
monotony
of
winter
indoors
with
a
toddler
.

restored
my
faith
in
mechaincs
.

i
spent
3
months
going
from
shop
to
shop
trying
to
get
my
ferrari
to
run
and
drive
the
way
it
should
.

i
was
about
to
give
up
when
i
met
jason
and
neal
.

they
took
on
the
challenge
of
making
my
ferrari
all
i
dreamed
of
and
more
.

the
crew
at
the
creative
workshop
went
over
and
above
the
call
of
duty
and
gave
me
back
a
car
i
can
drive
anywhere
and
finally
enjoy
owning
.

i
can
not
say
enough
about
this
place
.

they
have
restored
my
faith
in
mechanics
.

do
yourself
a
favor
,
call
these
guys
first
and
enjoy
driving
your
car
again
..

a
great
vacation
!

we
wanted
to
see
the
sun
-
and
we
also
got
much
more
!

excellent
chefs
are
in
the
kitchen
preparing
memorable
breakfasts
.

after
a
train
ride
over
the
mountains
,
we
enjoyed
hiking
in
the
flower
-
filled
wenatchee
hills
(
in
may
)
and
a
very
interesting
bike
ride
in
a
loop
around
the
columbia
river
...
and
then
wine
if
we
wanted
it
on
the
patio
in
the
evening
....

this
is
a
busy
group
of
hosts
they
are
also
running
a
restaurant
,
which
also
must
be
wonderful
-
so
just
ask
for
what
you
need
,
and
i
'm
sure
they
will
do
their
best
to
be
hospitable
.

omg

omg
..
make
sure
to
book
a
reservation
,
as
this
magical
place
is
packed
(
in
a
nice
way
)
i
love
that
the
owner
walks
around
and
cares
how
his
customers
feel
about
their
food
.

the
waiters
are
like
no
other
...

my
waiter
was
so
excellent
i
gave
him
a
75
%
tip
,
and
it
was
worht
every
penny
..

the
food
was
finger
licking
the
bowel
fantastic
..

i
just
discovered
her
has
a
place
right
near
my
work
(
color
me
phat
)
if
you
are
looking
for
a
romatic
place
with
the
best
food
and
service
in
the
valley
giovanni
ristorante
should
be
your
number
1
+
2
choice
.

holly
is
truely
the
best
hairstylist
!

i
have
lived
in
the
utc
la
jolla
area
for
many
years
,
and
i
never
new
this
salon
was
here
until
a
friend
reffered
me
to
see
holly
here
.

i
was
very
pleased
with
my
experience
here
.

all
of
the
people
were
friendly
and
welcoming
.

i
got
highlights
,
haircut
,
and
a
blowdry
.

she
did
a
great
job
!

holly
is
very
experienced
and
talented
,
and
i
could
tell
she
new
what
she
was
doing
right
off
the
bat
.

my
hair
looks
amazing
,
and
i
get
compliments
all
the
time
.

i
deffenitly
reccomend
this
salon
and
holly
to
anyone
.

you
will
not
be
disappointed
!!!!!!

outdated
but
not
bad

so
i
really
felt
like
this
place
was
extremely
outdated
especially
since
the
pictures
make
it
look
nice
and
modern
.

it
had
listed
that
there
was
a
hot
breakfast
but
all
this
meant
is
that
they
added
a
waffle
maker
to
the
common
continental
affair
at
most
cheap
hotels
.

the
family
suite
was
basically
two
rooms
with
a
small
opening
between
them
which
worked
great
for
us
because
we
were
two
families
traveling
together
.

if
you
are
in
town
and
need
that
kind
of
space
i
say
stay
here
but
if
you
are
looking
for
a
little
more
upscale
affair
do
n't
let
the
pictures
fool
you
and
book
somewhere
else
.

great
,
and
probably
the
only
west
indian
spot
worth
hitting
up
in
nashville
.

i
was
born
and
raised
in
toronto
,
which
has
a
huge
west
indian
(
trinidadian
,
jamaican
,
etc
)
population
.

so
huge
in
fact
,
that
toronto
slang
is
influenced
by
and
has
jamaican
references
,
and
jamaican
beef
patties
are
staples
in
my
high
school
cafeteria
.

anyway
,
i
was
practically
raised
on
this
stuff
,
and
being
a
connoisseur
of
west
indian
cuisine
,
jamaica
way
is
a
bit
toned
down
to
suit
the
american
palette
.

all
you
have
to
do
to
make
it
authentic
jamaican
food
,
is
add
a
whole
lot
of
pepper
.

a
lot
.

the
finest
christmas
trees
i
've
ever
seen
.

i
felt
like
i
was
in
heaven
when
i
walked
through
the
majestic
fields
of
this
particular
farm
.

the
trees
were
in
magnificent
shape
and
the
variety
was
astounding
.

the
owners
were
entertaining
and
gracious
.

i
especially
liked
the
eco
friendly
atmosphere
and
the
owner
s
love
of
all
animals
.

this
is
one
of
the
best
farms
i
have
ever
been
too
.

i
would
call
it
the
taj
mahal
of
the
east
coast
!

it
put
hair
on
my
chest
and
thanks
to
the
owner
s
advice
i
invested
vanguard
,
got
myself
a
woman
like
jerry
,
and
became
a
republican
.

thanks

pho
-
nomenal
!!

i
have
been
eating
pho
for
almost
my
entire
life
and
i
've
always
gone
to
the
pho
places
in
south
philly
and
off
the
boulevard
and
even
the
other
one
in
chinatown
,
but
when
i
tried
this
pho
place
,
it
blew
the
other
pho
houses
away
!!

all
of
the
pho
places
taste
the
same
to
me
,
so
what
seperates
one
from
the
other
is
the
service
and
the
price
.

the
service
here
is
incredible
compared
to
the
other
places
.

the
only
down
fall
of
this
pho
house
is
the
difficulty
in
finding
parking
in
chinatown
.

remember
to
bring
cash
since
they
do
n't
take
debit
or
credit
.

hope
this
helps
!!

had
a
horrible
experience
with
a
manager
here
,
rachel
mcinnis
,
she
was
rude
,
inconsiderate
and
did
not
do
the
right
thing
for
an
item
that
was
marked
incorrectly
...

i
'm
not
interested
in
shopping
in
a
place
with
people
like
her
...
she
refused
to
sell
me
the
item
at
its
marked
price
even
after
admitting
they
had
made
a
mistake
.

i
normally
do
n't
write
reviews
but
seeing
that
i
considered
dillards
a
distinguished
,
upscale
place
to
shop
,
this
one
wo
n't
be
getting
my
business
,
nor
my
family
's
,
nor
my
co-workers
.

it
's
never
ok
to
let
a
customer
walk
out
unhappy
,
especially
when
they
are
right
.

highly
recommend

i
work
as
a
transformational
life
coach
.

since
this
is
an
alternative
therapy
i
always
refer
clients
to
a
lisenced
therapist
when
i
feel
that
is
appropriate
.

i
found
her
through
a
colleague
one
day
when
one
of
my
clients
was
in
the
midst
of
a
panic
attack
and
needed
professional
help
that
i
am
not
qualified
to
provide
.

little
did
i
know
that
i
would
soon
be
needing
her
help
as
well
!

she
guided
me
through
a
very
difficult
period
dealing
with
a
family
member
's
suicide
,
coupled
with
elder
abuse
.

i
found
her
to
be
extremely
solid
,
kind
,
compassionate
,
and
intuitive
as
well
.

i
would
recommend
her
highly
!

they
wo
n't
have
a
second
chance
from
me
.

first
,
let
me
state
that
although
i
live
in
nyc
,
i
am
not
from
nyc
,
i
do
n't
care
about
baseball
and
i
absolutely
love
boston
to
death
(
so
beautiful
,
so
clean
,
so
awesome
)
.

that
said
,
i
hated
this
restaurant
.

the
service
was
just
about
as
good
as
i
'd
get
in
nyc
(
that
means
it
was
poor
)
and
the
food
was
almost
mediocre
.

the
decor
left
a
lot
to
be
desired
and
the
posters
telling
me
all
the
reasons
99
was
great
just
served
as
an
ironic
contrast
against
the
reality
.

personally
i
recommend
you
take
your
money
elsewhere

when
i
arrived
at
brickell
honda
on
6/4/11
,
i
was
greeted
and
attended
to
by
the
sales
manager
,
gustavo
guerra
,
in
a
very
friendly
and
professional
manner
.

i
explained
to
him
what
i
wanted
and
that
i
previously
went
to
braman
honda
.

bramen
honda
was
a
bit
of
a
hassle
.

he
told
me
"
no
problem
,
we
will
match
the
offer
or
do
better
.
"

mr.
guerra
gave
me
a
better
deal
without
any
hassles
nor
any
type
of
problems
.

brickell
honda
has
been
the
best
buying
experience
in
the
world
.

i
urge
all
st.
thomas
the
apostle
parishioners
and
all
of
south
florida
residents
to
come
see
gus
!!!

excellent
customer
service
!!!

great
,
honest
service

i
took
my
2001
nissan
frontier
in
to
fix
a
cracked
manifold
.

the
dealer
wanted
$
1300
to
fix
that
and
another
$
1500
to
fix
some
other
things
.

eagle
transmission
determined
that
much
of
the
work
the
dealer
said
needed
to
be
done
was
unneccesary
and
what
needed
to
be
fixed
was
only
$
400
!!

i
was
so
impressed
with
the
honesty
and
integrity
of
mike
and
everyone
at
eagle
transmission
!

i
dropped
the
truck
off
in
the
morning
and
it
was
ready
that
afternoon
.

i
have
finally
found
a
mechanic
i
trust
!!

and
it
was
great
that
they
did
not
charge
a
service
fee
to
diagnose
the
problem
-
an
added
bonus
!!

dr.
shady

kelly
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
.

"
dr.
shady
"
is
a
jerk
.

after
the
way
she
spoke
to
me
on
my
last
visit
,
i
will
not
be
returning
!!

good
luck
keeping
business
with
that
stuck
up
attitude
dr.
shady
.

you
have
just
lost
mine
.

the
next
time
you
feel
like
being
condescending
to
someone
,
it
is
not
going
to
be
me
!!!!!!

dr.
shady
is
inexperienced
and
prideful
.

she
probably
does
not
even
have
10
%
of
the
knowledge
that
some
of
the
other
experienced
vets
do
in
this
area
.

i
will
be
carefully
researching
vets
before
i
take
my
dog
someplace
else
.

beautifully
written
reviews
doctor
,
but
completely
untrue
.

poor
experience

i
did
not
have
a
good
experience
w
/
dr.
ghassemlou
.

during
the
session
,
he
demanded
to
have
my
physical
address
,
which
i
've
always
kept
private
as
i
am
enrolled
in
a
witness
protection
program
.

i
believe
he
is
correct
in
that
he
needs
my
physical
address
for
legal
reasons
,
however
,
he
did
not
adequately
explain
this
during
our
session
.

i
learned
more
about
this
doing
my
own
research
afterward
.

i
think
he
could
've
done
more
to
assuage
my
concerns
by
giving
me
concrete
facts
.

saying
that
i
need
to
give
him
my
address
or
else
i
have
intimacy
issues
is
not
helpful
.

it
's
pretty
combative
actually
.

you
'll
love
it

i
have
had
my
back
fused
in
2
places
.

i
wish
that
i
had
n't
done
this
.

with
these
fusions
,
chiropractric
is
n't
as
successful
,
but
it
still
is
very
helpful
.

even
after
my
fusions
,
my
back
continued
to
hurt
,
but
now
it
does
n't
hurt
any
more
.

i
would
encourage
anyone
who
is
thinking
of
back
surgery
,
to
talk
about
different
treatment
options
first
with
dr.
de
barros
.

he
really
knows
what
he
is
talking
about
and
will
approach
the
different
options
fairly
.

you
can
see
different
treatments
that
a
surgeon
ca
n't
see
,
so
that
you
can
have
several
treatment
options
before
you
decide
what
to
do
.

unbelievably
huge
experience
for
such
a
small
salon
!!!

i
have
been
to
kim
at
cheveux
for
more
than
five
years
.

i
can
not
tell
you
how
often
i
am
complimented
on
my
hair
(
style
and
color
)
!

i
regularly
request
kim
's
business
cards
as
i
am
often
stopped
on
the
street
and
asked
"
who
does
your
hair
...
i
love
it
!!!
"

quaint
,
lovely
,
small
salon
with
big
personality
.

i
am
made
to
feel
special
when
i
am
in
the
chair
and
i
have
never
had
a
less
than
amazing
cut
or
color
experience
.

my
hair
has
never
felt
this
healthy
,
either
.

i
can
not
recommend
this
salon
enough
!!!

thanks
cheveux
!

my
favorite
in
mclean

my
family
loves
coming
to
endo
sushi
.
they
are
very
nice
,
it
is
never
crowded
,
and
the
food
is
wonderful
,
very
delicious
and
fresh
!

sometimes
it
is
hard
to
get
parking
in
the
lot
in
front
of
the
storefront
,
and
it
is
on
a
one
-
way
street
,
but
the
restaurant
itself
is
never
overcrowded
.

if
you
can
not
park
in
the
lot
,
then
you
can
park
in
the
shopping
center
's
garage
,
and
walk
up
to
endo
sushi
.

the
service
is
fast
.

be
sure
to
ring
the
little
bell
on
your
way
out
if
you
enjoyed
your
meal
!

(
it
's
by
the
door
,
on
the
hostess
stand
)

horrible
service
!

i
got
yelled
at
,
literally
yelled
at
because
i
asked
if
i
could
pick
up
my
car
5
-
10
minutes
late
.

i
explained
that
i
was
already
on
my
way
and
i
would
rush
to
get
there
as
soon
as
i
could
because
i
needed
my
car
for
work
at
5
am
,
but
the
guy
was
arguing
with
me
saying
he
was
gon
na
lock
the
doors
right
at
5:30
.

rude
,
unprofessional
,
just
jerks
.

seems
like
all
they
care
about
is
the
money
and
getting
home
on
time
,
no
care
for
the
customers
at
all
!!!

missed
a
whole
day
of
work
because
i
am
now
carless
.

i
will
neeeeeeeeeverrrr
go
to
this
place
again
.

superb
arrangements

i
used
fancy
flowers
for
my
late
husband
's
funeral
flowers
as
they
had
been
recommended
to
me
.

i
am
so
glad
that
i
called
in
to
see
ana
,
she
is
a
lovely
girl
who
showed
nothing
but
care
and
compassion
towards
me
.

the
flowers
were
all
that
i
hoped
they
would
be
,
i
have
attended
several
funerals
of
late
unfortunately
and
the
flowers
i
recieved
from
ana
outshone
them
all
.

she
is
so
talented
,
the
flowers
were
arranged
superbly
and
delicately
,
it
is
so
obvious
to
see
the
difference
between
someone
fully
trained
and
skilled
compared
to
others
.

thank
you
ana
i
hope
to
see
you
in
the
future
under
better
circumstances
.

great
first
experience
.

i
'm
22
,
and
my
hairdresser
was
great
(
and
not
"
old
"
like
one
of
the
reviews
says
)
-
she
really
listened
to
what
i
wanted
and
gave
me
tons
of
tips
on
how
to
style
my
hair
so
i
could
get
it
to
look
the
way
i
wanted
it
to
.

she
deep
conditioned
my
hair
and
took
the
time
to
style
it
properly
.

she
recommended
products
but
absolutely
did
n't
pressure
me
to
buy
.

it
's
a
cute
place
with
a
really
friendly
,
laid
-
back
atmosphere
.

i
would
highly
recommend
it
and
will
be
going
back
for
my
next
haircut
.

oh
!

and
students
get
$
5
off
,
ca
n't
argue
with
that
.

smoker
s
haven

yeah
,
this
complex
is
not
very
good
.

our
bathroom
fan
,
one
electric
outlet
and
2
leaky
sinks
have
yet
to
be
fixed
.

both
bathrooms
look
like
they
were
flooded
and
the
wood
cabinets
are
thrashed
at
the
bottom
and
they
slapped
some
pieces
of
wood
over
to
try
to
cover
it
up
.

and
non-smokers
beware
!!!

i
think
90
percent
of
the
tenants
are
smokers
!

if
you
do
not
smoke
,
do
not
move
here
.

our
unit
reeks
of
old
cigarette
smoke
and
it
started
to
become
apparent
a
few
weeks
after
we
moved
in
.

you
can
not
walk
5
feet
without
smelling
that
disgusting
cigarette
smoke
and
it
blows
right
into
the
windows
all
day
and
all
night
.

great
sanwiches
,
great
prices

i
used
to
go
here
almost
every
day
since
i
work
in
the
neighbourhood
and
loved
their
turkey
and
meatball
sandwiches
.

chicken
salad
salad
is
great
too
.

best
of
all
,
the
staff
is
quick
on
their
feet
and
even
with
long
lines
,
usually
serve
you
in
5
minutes
or
less
.

for
the
quality
,
the
prices
(
$
4
-
$
6
)
have
to
be
the
best
in
town
.

the
staff
get
to
know
regulars
and
do
their
job
very
well
.

tourists
like
the
other
reviewer
might
not
appreciate
their
efficiency
or
quality
,
but
i
certainly
do
.

this
is
n't
a
tgif
or
cafe
,
it
s
a
lunch
sandwich
place
and
a
good
one
at
that
.

rate
a
church
?

might
as
well
just
hotpot
the
curb
and
rate
the
traffic
light
.

it
's
a
bloody
church
,
for
chrisssake
!

big
,
grey
and
imposing
.

go
there
on
christian
holidays
for
a
bit
of
churchy
grandure
.

the
pastor
at
this
church
is
cool
,
i
met
him
after
some
holiday
service
.

he
had
a
robe
that
was
made
back
in
the
'60s
.

god
was
pleased
with
that
one
!

it
's
historical
for
sf
,
so
when
your
aunte
comes
for
a
visit
,
take
her
there
.

great
for
the
kiddies
-
they
love
the
labyrinth
(
do
n't
forget
to
tell
'em
it
s
really
a
'
pagen
'
thing
!
)
.

stop
by
at
least
once
or
you
'll
go
to
heck
!

ok
but
just
becuse
we
where
on
a
tight
budget
.

me
and
my
dad
where
in
nj
for
a
kc
chiefs
(
my
home
team
)
vs
the
ny
jets
and
for
game
4
of
the
world
series
.

i
'm
a
red
sox
fan
so
i
was
glad
that
the
phillies
won
.

the
knights
inn
was
small
very
small
.
i
mean
1
room
in
every
room
!
it
was
cozy
a
little
and
a
small
tv
.

i
mean
a
2
day
stay
was
a
ok
stay
even
tho
the
manager
looked
like
he
was
chineze
and
that
we
only
slept
and
went
out
from
8
to
7
to
see
new
york
.

but
sice
we
almost
just
slept
there
i
ca
nt
give
that
good
of
a
review

it
was
a
saturday
and
my
spring
was
broken
...

i
googled
garage
door
repair
in
woodinville
and
found
ndi
-
johnette
answered
the
phone
and
was
oh
-
so
pleasant
and
helpful
!

she
sort
of
appologized
for
dan
taking
the
day
off
to
go
skiing
-
but
he
could
do
the
repair
on
sunday
!

i
said
great
and
dan
arrived
on
time
at
10
am
to
make
the
repair
.

i
enjoyed
speaking
with
dan
,
and
learning
more
about
how
the
springs
are
sized
for
these
doors
.

the
repair
went
quickly
and
the
price
was
extremely
fair
.

i
would
highly
recommend
ndi
-
and
will
spread
the
word
to
my
neighbors
.

thanks
dan
and
johnette
for
your
responsiveness
and
professional
service
.

roger
m.
,
woodinville

i
would
n't
send
my
dogs
there
.

i
had
a
conversation
with
the
woman
running
this
place
in
april
2010
.

she
basically
said
if
the
children
getting
off
the
bus
are
n't
paying
to
enter
her
building
she
was
going
to
let
them
wander
around
the
streets
.

wow
,
really
?

with
all
the
child
predators
out
there
,
a
busy
road
,
cars
speeding
by
......
and
you
are
going
to
let
some
4
/
5
year
olds
wonder
around
cause
you
're
money
hungry
?

real
christian
of
you
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

whether
they
pay
me
or
not
,
if
their
parents
get
into
an
accident
,
stuck
in
traffic
,
etc.
the
last
thing
i
would
do
is
let
a
child
get
raped
because
i
was
n't
paid
.

excellent
service

i
could
easily
go
to
nordstrom
for
my
designer
jeans
and
pay
the
same
price
,
but
i
go
to
the
garment
district
for
their
service
.

previous
reviewers
said
they
were
pushy
and
i
can
understand
that
,
but
i
find
the
staff
more
helpful
than
anything
else
.

tiffany
is
fabulous
!

i
came
in
for
alterations
(
free
,
by
the
way
)
and
told
her
about
a
stain
i
had
on
my
new
leather
purse
.

she
immediately
went
to
the
back
,
brought
out
leather
cleaner
and
cleaned
my
purse
on
the
spot
.

i
did
n't
even
buy
the
bag
there
!

huge
selection
and
,
great
suggestions
from
the
staff
and
they
refer
you
to
reliable
places
if
they
do
n't
have
what
you
need
.

we
were
expecting
a
great
experience
,
when
we
recieved
a
friendly
greeting
by
the
hosts
.

the
atmosphere
was
nice
and
very
clean
.

the
menu
had
plenty
of
options
even
for
picky
eaters
.

the
service
was
ok
,
our
waitress
kept
forgetting
our
drinks
even
though
we
reminded
her
several
times
.

to
start
we
tried
the
guacamole
and
salsa
verde
,
it
was
completly
flavorless
.

we
should
have
left
then
.

we
orderd
our
meals
anyway
,
chimichangas
,
jalapeno
borritos
,
and
quesadillas
.

everything
was
bland
,
completely
void
of
any
spice
or
flavor
.

we
have
never
had
mexican
food
this
bad
,
it
was
just
simply
gross
.

hopefully
they
spice
things
up
or
they
wo
nt
be
in
business
long
.

i
recommend
la
hacienda

might
try
again

pros
:
*
jill
,
the
owner
,
is
very
nice
and
really
cares
about
her
feedback
*
pretty
nice
atmosphere
*
great
dessert
*
not
your
typical
veggie
selection
,
i
like
!

do
n't
know
where
else
you
can
find
purple
hull
peas
and
some
of
the
other
sides
.

cons
:
*
server
was
n't
very
pleasant
*
pretty
small
portion
on
the
blackened
catfish
*
overcooked
food
*
time
,
took
about
25
minutes
from
ordering
to
eating
.

half
the
tables
and
bar
were
empty
by
this
point
.

other
thoughts
:
will
try
this
place
again
.

there
must
be
a
reason
so
many
people
like
it
there
.

their
club
sandwich
looks
tasty
,
maybe
that
'll
change
my
mind
....
and
a
different
server
.

very
professional
/
very
helpful

the
people
at
fidelity
leasing
were
very
friendly
and
helpful
.

i
was
looking
for
a
car
but
did
not
really
know
what
i
wanted
and
they
were
very
helpful
and
took
the
time
to
first
figure
out
what
my
needs
were
and
showing
me
various
options
to
meet
those
needs
.

they
seemed
more
interested
in
helping
me
find
the
right
car
rather
then
just
make
a
sale
.

my
experience
with
them
was
great
-
low
stress
,
very
helpful
and
very
personal
.

after
finding
the
car
i
wanted
they
took
the
time
to
go
over
each
step
and
making
it
as
painless
as
possible
.

from
start
to
finish
they
were
top
notch
.

i
would
highly
recommend
calling
these
people
up
for
your
next
car
.

this
insurance
co.
is
a
joke
!!!

they
have
absolutely
no
communication
skills
whatsoever
.

if
you
do
n't
mind
being
robbed
,
cheated
or
lied
to
then
this
is
the
company
for
you
.

they
will
make
every
attempt
to
misinform
and
misrepresent
themselves
.

they
make
up
excuses
in
hopes
to
confuse
their
policy
holders
with
misinformation
.

as
an
example
they
took
payment
for
5
out
of
6
monthly
plan
premiums
for
a
yearly
policy
and
cancelled
the
contract
for
the
remainder
of
the
policy
for
reasons
they
stated
was
not
receiving
information
on
other
licensed
drivers
in
the
household
?

i
personally
provided
the
request
on
four
separate
occasions
and
they
claim
there
is
a
glitch
in
their
systems
?

ifa
is
an
acronym
for
i
m
a
f%#king
assh@%$e
!!!

fantastic
service
!

i
have
been
here
a
few
times
for
oil
changes
and
just
got
my
tires
,
alignment
and
state
inspection
done
yesterday
.

i
shopped
it
around
and
they
were
extremely
competitive
in
pricing
and
also
added
nitrogen
to
my
tires
which
should
extend
the
life
and
get
me
better
gas
mileage
.

it
also
came
with
free
balance
and
rotation
for
the
life
of
the
tires
!

what
made
it
perfect
was
that
they
offered
transportation
so
that
i
would
not
have
to
wait
there
or
take
time
off
of
work
to
go
back
and
forth
or
try
to
find
a
ride
.

great
service
,
great
pricing
and
super
convenient
!

i
also
did
not
feel
like
they
tried
to
sell
me
a
bunch
of
services
that
i
did
not
need
.

love
my
home
at
creekside

i
moved
to
creekside
apartments
in
august
2008
with
a
6
-
month
lease
and
have
just
extended
it
for
another
13
months
!

the
management
from
julie
and
janice
to
the
work
staff
,
esp.
edwin
,
are
just
wonderful
.

they
have
been
extremely
helpful
whenever
i
have
asked
for
help
.

although
the
apartments
are
facing
stokes
street
and
close
to
the
bascom
light
rail
,
the
location
is
surprisingly
quiet
.

i
have
never
had
any
problems
with
loud
neighbors
or
concerns
about
safety
.

the
apartments
are
within
walking
distance
to
trader
joe
's
,
whole
foods
,
and
other
stores
.

the
well
-
equipped
,
clean
gym
is
a
plus
!

great
place
to
live
if
you
work
in
and
around
downtown
san
jose
!

i
interviewed
several
contractors
for
a
kitchen
remodel
.

liberty
construction
shows
up
and
it
's
two
guys
...
all
i
get
is
100
%
sales
pitch
"
we
're
the
best
...
we
're
number
50
so
we
must
be
doing
something
right
...
look
at
all
these
certificates
that
say
we
're
great
"
.

not
once
did
i
feel
listened
to
like
they
actually
cared
about
what
i
wanted
,
all
they
were
interested
in
was
me
signing
a
contract
right
then
and
there
.

very
high
pressured
sales
and
with
the
reviews
of
many
others
bad
service
.

i
'm
glad
i
trusted
my
gut
and
did
n't
get
sucked
into
doing
business
with
them
.

find
someone
you
trust
that
actually
hears
you
and
wants
to
do
the
job
right
.

do
n't
waste
your
time
or
money
!

i
took
my
3
year
old
son
here
at
the
weekend
and
to
be
honest
,
apart
from
the
shark
walkway
,
i
thought
it
was
rubbish
and
overpriced
.

even
taking
into
account
the
fact
that
my
3
year
old
wanted
to
run
most
of
the
way
round
,
it
took
us
just
over
one
hour
start
to
finish
.

if
you
have
been
to
the
london
aquarium
i
would
not
even
bother
with
this
.

if
you
are
really
desperate
for
something
to
pass
the
time
and
are
willing
to
shell
out
the
best
part
of
l
30
for
2
two
people
then
go
for
it
.

(
for
some
reason
it
will
not
let
me
rate
it
one
star
-
it
is
not
rated
5
by
me
!
)

cranmore
dental
and
implant
clinic
:
i
could
not
recommend
dr
david
nelson
enough
.

i
had
a
severe
phobia
of
attending
the
dentist
until
i
met
and
was
treated
by
dr
nelson
.

he
instantaneously
put
me
at
ease
and
his
ongoing
treatments
have
been
absolutely
pain
free
.

my
previous
apprehension
has
been
dismissed
and
i
no
longer
have
a
sinking
feeling
when
my
next
appointment
is
due
!

in
addition
to
the
core
treatment
,
dr
nelson
has
impressed
me
further
with
his
concern
and
interest
in
the
well
-
being
of
his
patients
-
his
dental
work
underpinned
by
a
strong
duty
of
care
to
every
patient
.

he
is
always
prepared
to
go
the
extra
mile
to
ensure
that
any
patient
discomfort
is
dealt
with
immediately

pam

best
salsa
(
hehehe
)

after
my
trees
were
cleaned
up
,
they
gave
me
a
jar
of
salsa
.

the
owner
warned
me
that
it
was
the
best
salsa
i
would
ever
had
,
and
he
was
right
.

no
joke
!

i
hate
to
say
check
them
out
just
for
the
salsa
,
but
james
,
i
need
another
jar
badly
:)
all
kidding
aside
,
they
are
a
very
good
company
,
i
have
a
hard
time
giving
any
service
biz
a
5
star
review
but
they
came
close
.

very
affordable
(
do
n't
call
it
cheap
)
and
their
trimmers
were
quick
and
courteous
when
i
got
home
from
work
.

and
the
salsa
,
be
sure
to
ask
for
a
jar
and
have
plenty
of
chips
around
,
you
will
need
them
.....

dr.
mann
killed
our
pet

yea
,
dr.
mann
ai
n't
so
great
.

we
took
our
beloved
kitty
to
him
and
it
came
back
dead
.

we
live
in
the
sub-division
around
the
corner
and
after
it
happened
and
we
brought
it
up
at
some
neighborhood
gatherings
we
discovered
that
several
people
from
this
neighborhood
alone
had
pets
go
to
dr.
mann
for
surgical
procedures
and
came
back
dead
.

if
you
take
him
here
for
shots
,
no
big
deal
but
i
would
never
let
this
man
apply
anesthetic
to
my
pet
ever
again
.

oh
,
they
also
charged
me
for
the
procedure
(
$
250
)
and
had
the
audacity
to
charge
me
a
$
25
'
disposal
'
fee
.

they
actually
itemized
it
as
a
disposal
fee
.

avoid
at
all
costs
.

one
of
the
worst
places

this
place
and
its
sister
store
peking
garden
are
the
worst
places
to
order
from
.

the
food
was
horrible
not
cooked
like
it
should
be
,
they
got
the
order
wrong
on
a
number
of
occasions
,
and
once
forgot
about
my
order
.

i
had
to
call
back
up
there
two
hours
later
and
the
lady
(
who
claimed
to
be
a
manager
)
said
my
food
was
on
the
way
,
and
she
did
nt
offer
to
compensate
me
in
any
kind
of
way
.

i
waited
another
30
mins
before
receiving
my
food
and
it
was
cold
.

in
my
opinon
this
place
should
be
shut
down
by
the
health
inspector
,
and
anyone
who
is
satisfied
with
there
service
and
food
has
never
eaten
at
a
real
asian
restaurant
.

gone
downhill
since
change
in
ownership

sigh
.

i
used
to
love
this
place
.

but
now
that
they
are
part
of
a
chain
,
service
has
slipped
.

i
am
waiting
longer
at
bna
for
my
pickups
and
last
time
i
parked
with
them
,
they
lost
my
car
key
.

lucky
i
had
a
spare
with
me
!

to
date
they
have
not
made
good
by
either
finding
the
key
or
paying
for
a
new
one
.

(
these
new
car
keys
are
expensive
to
copy
,
you
ca
n't
just
go
to
walmart
.
)

go
to
the
website
for
coupons
and
join
the
club
-
you
can
get
free
parking
.

however
,
with
bna
offering
one
day
of
free
parking
due
to
construction
of
the
new
rental
car
facility
,
it
may
be
cheaper
to
park
at
bna
.

wife
and
i
attempted
to
adopt
a
dog
and
was
nothing
but
frustrating
.

we
arrived
sunday
at
about
230
and
found
a
do
we
really
liked
.

we
were
told
that
we
could
n't
today
because
they
were
closing
soon
.

i
called
the
next
morning
to
let
then
know
my
wife
would
be
driving
in
.

they
gave
me
the
run
around
and
missing
paperwork
only
to
call
back
to
tell
me
someone
else
wanted
her
and
i
would
need
to
come
in
and
put
down
a
deposit
.

i
work
2
hours
away
but
offered
my
card
over
the
phone
.

they
refused
.

terrible
communication
as
well
.

at
one
point
they
told
me
the
dog
had
been
fixed
,
the
next
day
it
had
n't
.

huge
ammount
of
time
wasted
time
and
elevated
blood
pressure
.

college
is
a
joke
and
the
salon
is
a
joke
!

went
to
the
school
here
over
priced
!!!!!!

you
do
not
learn
the
things
you
were
promised
.

you
have
to
bring
in
your
own
models
and
they
have
to
pay
for
you
to
use
them
if
you
do
nt
then
you
can
graduate
!

going
back
after
graduating
you
r
told
you
get
a
discount
on
services
nope
you
do
nt
.

staff
is
under
educated
.

going
there
you
learn
the
school
does
not
care
about
the
services
given
just
about
the
money
.

over
priced
for
students
to
learn
!

beware
of
the
nail
program
you
are
not
taught
to
use
a
nail
drill
at
all
you
learn
the
old
fashioned
way
of
doing
nails
you
will
not
be
able
to
do
well
in
a
salon
!!!

beware
!

you
can
fool
people

this
store
is
proof
that
you
can
fool
people
with
good
advertising
.

they
convince
lots
of
people
that
they
are
a
great
store
,
when
in
fact
they
are
a
very
average
place
at
best
,
they
are
just
another
big
box
store
like
the
others
.

they
offer
sales
that
are
n't
really
sales
,
mislabeled
items
that
make
the
item
sound
like
a
good
deal
when
it
is
n't
,
a
bad
attitude
about
return
items
,
and
on
and
on
.

with
higher
than
average
prices
to
boot
!

so
do
n't
get
taken
in
,
keep
your
eyes
open
if
you
choose
to
shop
here
.

on
the
other
hand
,
the
richmond
ukrops
chain
is
known
for
its
charity
work
,
its
community
action
,
and
its
interest
in
the
public
welfare
.

never
again

do
n't
go
here
unless
you
want
to
sit
,
order
,
eat
and
be
asked
to
leave
all
in
a
matter
of
20
minutes
.

you
wo
n't
even
have
time
to
read
the
entire
menu
before
being
asked
to
order
and
if
you
ask
for
more
time
your
server
will
wait
at
the
table
.

this
is
the
only
place
i
have
ever
eaten
and
been
told
to
leave
because
other
people
were
waiting
.

i
was
told
to
take
my
coffee
to
go
if
i
wanted
to
finish
it
.

oh
,
and
their
liquor
license
was
expired
so
no
bloody
mary
or
mimosas
.

plus
the
drinks
are
self
service
,
have
fun
trying
to
negotiate
the
small
cafeteria
space
to
get
your
coffee
,
juice
or
water
.

go
next
door
to
the
ball
square
cafe
instead
.

i
guess
you
get
what
you
pay
for
.

i
tried
to
stay
here
for
a
few
nights
with
my
girlfriend
,
so
we
asked
for
a
single
queen
bed
.

we
got
there
,
and
we
were
treated
to
the
free
"
upgrade
"
of
a
room
with
two
double
beds
.

since
they
consider
this
an
upgrade
,
they
let
their
other
rooms
fill
up
and
would
not
change
our
room
.

then
we
got
put
in
a
room
with
a
huge
gap
under
the
door
....
right
next
to
the
ice
machine
.

we
could
hear
every
single
thing
that
happened
outside
like
it
was
inside
our
room
.

when
i
finally
found
someone
at
the
desk
who
could
speak
english
,
they
moved
our
room
,
but
we
still
did
not
receive
the
single
queen
we
had
"
reserved
"

i
was
thoroughly
impressed
!

i
had
a
problem
with
the
tile
in
my
bathroom
coming
apart
.

i
called
a
few
different
businesses
in
the
area
to
get
estimates
,
they
were
n't
the
cheapest
i
found
but
very
reasonable
.

the
best
part
is
i
got
my
whole
bathroom
remodeled
for
about
the
same
price
the
other
compan's
were
quoting
just
to
fix
the
shower
tile
and
fixtures
.

they
had
the
work
done
in
about
half
the
time
quoted
which
made
me
and
my
wife
extremely
happy
.

we
have
had
nothing
but
compliments
on
our
bathroom
when
guest
come
over
-
who
would
have
guessed
that
one
?

very
nice
work
and
friendly
guys
too
.

best
money
i
've
spent
on
remodeling
ever
.

i
highly
recommend
any
one
considering
home
repair
to
give
these
guys
a
call
.

new
training
centre
is
excellent

the
award
dance
centre
has
moved
from
its
holderness
road
site
to
a
new
complex
on
chamberlain
road
hull
.

the
new
centre
has
4
studios
planned
and
now
boasts
the
largest
single
dance
floor
area
in
kingston
upon
hull
.

the
classes
cover
all
age
and
skill
ranges
,
with
ballroom
,
latin
,
sequence
,
street
,
disco
,
line
dancing
,
ballet
,
tap
&
jazz
.

we
have
attended
a
ward
dance
centre
for
over
a
year
and
really
enjoy
the
friendly
and
welcoming
way
we
are
taught
ballroom
and
latin
as
well
as
the
fun
filled
social
dance
evening
held
every
saturday
evening
....

it
is
not
really
possible
to
score
this
school
too
highly
,
we
would
give
it
12
out
of
10
and
5
stars
across
the
board

&
anne

i
purchased
a
2
-
year
old
certified
pre-owned
bmw
from
this
dealership
.

the
night
i
drove
back
home
,
i
found
that
the
rear
window
has
some
leakage
.

(
you
can
hear
the
wind
while
driving
on
highway
.

very
likely
it
needs
a
new
window
seal
)
.

i
admit
that
i
should
have
paid
attention
to
this
kind
of
little
things
while
test
drive
.

(
but
this
is
a
certified
car
from
a
dealer
.
)

so
i
brought
the
car
back
the
second
day
.

they
told
me
that
this
is
not
under
warranty
and
want
to
charge
me
$
175
just
to
diagnose
the
problem
!

who
knows
how
much
they
want
me
to
pay
to
fix
this
thing
.

i
walked
away
.

so
my
advice
is
that
never
trust
this
dealer
.

stay
away
as
far
as
possible
.

perfect
practice

after
i
had
chosen
the
fountain
dental
practice
they
provided
a
slick
and
professional
service
from
start
to
finish
.

everyone
was
friendly
from
the
receptionist
to
the
surgeon
herself
,
putting
me
at
my
ease
and
explaining
the
whole
process
,
both
initially
and
then
as
we
went
along
.

surgery
visit
timings
were
always
made
to
suit
me
and
not
them
and
they
gave
me
the
feeling
that
i
mattered
and
was
important
to
them
.

the
surgery
itself
is
slick
,
modern
and
very
relaxed
and
i
always
felt
that
i
was
in
capable
hands
.

my
dental
surgeon
,
dr.
lucy
nichols
is
clearly
a
dental
perfectionist
and
clearly
proud
both
of
the
work
she
does
and
the
reputation
she
has
established
.

everyone
was
so
helpful
that
i
can
not
wait
to
go
back
.....

wonderful
service
for
large
group

i
had
my
wedding
luncheon
at
this
bj
s
restaurant
,
and
it
was
one
of
the
best
choices
that
i
made
.

it
was
a
great
deal
--
we
paid
a
certain
amount
per
person
,
and
my
husband
and
i
chose
4
types
of
pizza
and
the
servers
brought
out
as
much
as
we
wanted
.

we
were
also
served
salad
and
soda
.

we
had
a
large
party
,
about
fifty
people
or
so
,
and
yet
everything
was
served
quickly
and
we
all
had
a
wonderful
time
.

even
though
we
were
only
supposed
to
have
those
specific
types
of
pizza
,
when
guests
asked
for
a
different
type
,
it
was
brought
out
with
no
charge
to
us
!

i
really
appreciate
bj
s
for
making
that
special
day
even
better
with
their
wonderful
food
and
service
.

wonderful

i
went
to
ohm
after
reading
some
of
the
reviews
.

i
go
to
school
in
the
area
and
usually
wait
until
i
go
home
to
get
my
hair
cut
.

i
decided
it
was
time
to
grow
up
and
made
an
appointment
.

sierra
was
my
stylist
and
i
love
what
she
did
.

i
have
wavy
hair
and
she
cut
to
my
hair
style
.

it
was
the
first
time
i
had
left
a
salon
with
my
hair
curly
.

usually
they
blow
dry
it
out
and
i
have
to
wait
until
i
wash
it
to
see
what
it
will
look
like
in
its
natural
state
.

but
she
did
a
fabulous
job
letting
me
know
what
she
was
doing
at
all
times
and
styled
my
hair
in
a
way
i
could
do
it
at
home
.

it
was
n't
completly
impossible
!!!!

i
am
definitely
going
back

after
recently
relocating
to
south
bend
,
we
were
looking
for
a
delicious
,
fun
,
yet
elegant
establishment
for
new
year
s
eve
dinner
.

we
were
disappointed
with
this
holiday
dinner
due
to
the
overall
flavor
and
price
of
the
meal
,
and
accessibility
to
the
jazz
club
.

the
meal
was
extremely
overpriced
and
lacked
flavor
,
especially
for
being
a
special
nye
menu
.

the
limited
menu
had
few
appetizing
options
and
the
nye
special
packages
were
way
overpriced
.

after
our
meal
,
our
server
found
us
a
table
in
the
jazz
club
where
we
were
informed
it
would
be
another
$
10
/
person
to
stay
and
listen
to
the
band
,
despite
the
fact
we
had
just
finished
a
dinner
there
and
were
intending
to
enjoy
their
drink
list
.

this
was
a
less
than
impressive
experience
at
trio
's
.

run
for
the
hills
...
you
'll
be
much
better
off
!

one
night
was
too
much
.

first
room
had
used
tissues
next
to
the
bed
and
i
requested
it
be
rectified
.

i
was
then
moved
to
another
room
around
the
back
where
the
room
was
dirty
,
the
shower
was
dirty
with
other
people
s
hair
in
it
,
the
toilet
seat
was
peeling
and
rough
and
the
bathroom
was
full
of
mould
.

i
called
reception
to
ask
if
they
knew
the
state
the
room
was
in
and
was
told
"
this
is
a
days
inn
,
not
the
hilton
"
and
the
receptionist
then
hung
up
on
me
.

to
warn
you
to
stay
away
from
this
place
just
is
n't
enough
.

there
was
not
one
ounce
of
caring
involved
and
anyone
i
can
warn
about
the
complete
lack
of
service
will
be
warned
.

grocery
and
daily
needs
store

before
using
fusionretail
before
installing
fusionretail
store
was
running
on
a
dos
based
software
.

we
were
having
a
major
problem
in
maintaining
cash
.

being
a
grocery
shop
,
maintaining
5000
different
products
was
a
challenging
job
.

managing
pos
counter
without
barcoding
was
really
a
tough
time
.

how
fusionretail
has
overcome
these
issues
?

fusionretail
helps
us
to
maintain
the
store
in
an
organised
way
.

usage
of
product
barcodes
and
smooth
maintenance
of
inventory
with
proper
recording
of
transactions
like
sale
,
purchase
and
returns
was
never
easy
before
.

how
long
does
it
take
to
train
new
people
at
work
?

billing
takes
15
minutes
and
back
office
jobs
takes
1
day
's
training
how
fast
your
support
queries
get
answered
?

over
telephone
,
immediate
.

on
call
,
it
takes
a
day
to
get
our
issues
resolved
.

ca
n't
wait
to
go
back
!!!

this
is
by
far
the
best
b&b
that
we
have
ever
stayed
at
!

we
were
in
santa
fe
for
a
special
event
and
our
hosts
rented
out
the
el
paradero
for
all
their
guests
to
stay
at
.

we
could
not
have
been
more
welcomed
,
more
comfortable
or
more
well
fed
.

the
weekend
was
perfect
in
every
way
,
in
large
part
to
sue
and
her
great
staff
.

everyone
was
so
friendly
and
really
went
out
of
their
way
to
make
sure
everything
went
well
.

we
can
not
wait
to
go
back
to
santa
fe
and
to
this
great
b&b
...
especially
my
4
year
old
,
who
made
friends
with
ms.
sue
and
all
the
ladies
,
and
has
talked
about
them
since
we
left
!

we
would
highly
recommend
the
el
paradero
on
your
next
trip
to
santa
fe
!

disatisfied
customer
,
i
went
through
kitchen
aid
and
used
one
of
their
recommended
vendors
.

a&e
came
out
,
charged
$
129
fee
just
to
walk
in
the
door
.

i
needed
a
part
for
my
appliance
,
the
cost
was
very
high
so
i
said
never
mind
,
paid
the
fee
and
called
a
local
business
for
a
second
quote
.

the
second
vendor
charged
$
55
(
less
than
half
of
what
a&e
charges
)
to
come
and
applied
that
to
the
price
of
the
repair
service
(
which
a&e
does
not
)
.

their
quote
came
in
at
half
the
price
of
a&e
for
the
same
work
and
same
part
.

seems
to
me
like
a&e
charges
way
more
than
necessary
!

very
disappointed
in
kitchen
aid
as
well
,
i
thought
that
they
pre-screened
their
vendors
for
price
and
quality
of
work
,
obviously
they
do
not
!

lovely
nails
on
cayuga
st.
in
lewiston
,
ny

first
let
me
start
out
by
saying
,
that
i
have
had
very
nice
pedicures
at
lovely
nails
on
military
road
.

i
was
very
excited
that
a
salon
was
opening
in
lewiston
,
as
i
live
in
youngstown
.

i
was
in
two
weeks
ago
and
had
the
worst
pedicure
that
i
have
had
in
my
life
.

there
were
four
of
us
and
i
was
taken
first
by
a
gentleman
.

i
put
my
foot
in
the
water
and
it
was
cool
.

he
did
warm
it
up
.

he
also
hurt
my
toes
will
pushing
my
cuticles
back
.

if
the
pedicure
lasted
20
mins.
,
that
was
a
stretch
.

the
other
ladies
had
a
similar
experience
,
both
had
nail
polish
on
a
couple
of
toes
.

none
of
us
will
be
using
their
services
again
,
which
is
a
shame
.

good
service
-
limited
results

andrew
was
helpful
and
knowledgeable
about
acupuncture
re
:
infertility
.

he
was
willing
to
talk
to
me
about
my
specific
issues
and
develop
a
plan
of
action
.

the
office
is
shared
with
a
foot
doctor
and
it
's
very
sterile
and
medical
feeling
,
which
i
liked
.

the
down
side
was
that
sometimes
there
was
a
lot
of
noise
in
the
hallway
from
other
patients
/
doctors
.

i
worked
with
andrew
for
2
months
and
did
acupuncture
and
herbs
.

the
sessions
were
nice
and
i
felt
relaxed
after
them
but
did
not
notice
any
changes
with
my
cycles
.

i
know
it
can
take
a
while
for
results
and
did
n't
expect
a
miracle
,
but
after
2
months
i
felt
like
it
was
not
entirely
worth
the
cost
/
time
.

(
i
am
also
a
little
suspicious
of
all
these
glowing
reviews
...
)

friendly
,
clean
and
excellent
location

the
staff
was
very
helpful
,
and
gave
us
good
advice
on
day
and
night
time
activities
.

common
room
was
comfortable
and
clean
,
very
good
room
to
read
or
relax
.
-

a
great
breakfast
which
was
included
every
morning
until
9:30
am
;
yummy
fresh
parisian
croissants
.

comfortable
and
clean
beds
,
a
bit
noisy
when
people
were
coming
in
late
from
a
night
out
,
but
we
did
n't
mind
too
much
as
we
were
also
just
coming
in
from
a
night
out
!

the
location
is
really
stellar
!

it
is
next
to
gare
du
nord
and
a
five
minute
walk
to
sacre
coeur
which
is
excellent
for
shopping
.

it
is
close
to
bus
lines
for
opera
plaza
,
galleries
lafayette
,
and
the
famous
flea
market
.

we
really
enjoyed
our
stay
and
would
definitely
stay
at
the
vintage
hostel
again
.

just
autos
thank
you
!

was
fast
and
easy
,
just
had
our
car
returned
this
morning
,
i
would
recommend
these
mobile
mechanics
for
sure
.

they
certainly
know
what
they
are
doing
.

the
mechanic
came
to
our
place
and
sorted
out
our
car
s
problems
,
he
explained
the
problem
and
was
very
up
front
and
honest
,
it
was
towed
to
the
workshop
as
the
gearbox
was
not
working
(
he
explained
it
better
)
.

they
phoned
the
same
day
,
confirmed
it
was
the
gearbox
quoted
me
the
job
,
i
gave
the
go
ahead
.

now
my
car
s
gears
and
brakes
have
never
run
so
well
...
ever
it
s
like
driving
a
new
car
.

so
yes
,
i
would
n't
hesitate
in
recommending
the
team
at
just
autos
for
easy
professional
car
repairs
,
thank
you
just
autos
for
your
help
.

i
stopped
in
today
@
yards
brewery
.

i
must
say
,
i
was
impressed
with
the
size
of
the
bar
area
and
lounge
,
&
i
liked
that
you
could
see
the
brewery
right
thru
the
glass
!

i
had
a
sampler
of
ipa
,
brawler
,
love
stout
&
esa
.

all
were
awesome
,
&
i
had
a
dogwood
grilled
cheese
which
was
enjoyable
with
the
fine
beers
.

after
my
sampler
&
sandwich
,
i
asked
for
a
pint
of
there
nitrogen
love
stout
,
i
must
say
i
was
impressed
,
with
the
great
taste
&
i
am
a
guiness
lover
so
coming
from
me
,
i
think
this
is
better
,
it
s
less
dry
&
smoother
!

if
you
are
in
philly
you
have
to
come
check
this
place
out
!

the
only
negative
i
have
abou
this
place
is
the
parking
!

i
left
with
a
case
of
brawler
!!!!

oil
change
disaster

my
wife
had
taken
her
'07
ford
fusion
in
for
a
routine
oil
change
.

a
couple
days
after
the
oil
change
,
the
engine
ran
rough
,
the
low
oil
pressure
light
would
come
on
sporadically
,
and
the
engine
would
whir
loudly
.

turns
out
the
engine
had
no
oil
,
and
when
oil
was
put
it
,
it
would
just
run
out
of
the
filter
.

there
could
have
(
hopefully
does
n't
have
)
major
damage
to
the
engine
.

all
of
this
started
after
their
oil
change
.

once
they
realized
their
mistake
they
sent
a
mechanic
and
tow
truck
to
my
wife
's
work
and
towed
it
back
to
fix
it
.

i
would
not
recommend
this
shop
for
anything
,
not
even
something
as
simple
as
an
oil
change
.

plus
they
will
overcharge
you
for
just
about
everything
,
and
smile
while
doing
it
.

liars
,
negative
stars
!

took
my
cruze
in
twice
for
poor
fuel
economy
.

the
first
time
they
claimed
to
get
reasonable
mpg
.

however
,
they
would
never
drive
the
car
with
me
in
it
to
prove
their
findings
.

i
wonder
if
they
were
going
down
a
hill
!

they
told
me
to
bring
it
back
after
5000
miles
.

i
brought
it
back
with
9000
miles
.

they
"
finished
"
the
work
and
told
me
the
car
was
ready
.

i
found
out
they
did
not
even
drive
the
car
,
stated
they
looked
at
it
before
.

they
still
would
not
drive
the
car
with
me
to
show
their
mpg
number
.

they
also
claimed
not
to
see
anything
wrong
with
the
blower
fan
(
a
seperate
issue
)
,
but
when
i
drove
the
car
home
i
had
the
same
symptoms
.

i
will
never
purchace
another
vehicle
from
vic
canever
.

great
job

i
want
to
say
that
mike
did
a
great
job
for
our
family
in
our
time
of
need
.

both
my
grandparents
passed
away
4
months
apart
and
mike
was
very
understanding
.

it
was
a
very
trying
time
for
my
family
and
myself
yet
mike
took
the
time
to
greet
each
and
every
one
one
of
us
.

he
is
very
professional
in
his
position
as
a
director
and
yet
he
still
made
time
to
be
compassionate
for
what
we
were
all
going
through
.

i
'm
sure
it
s
not
every
day
that
a
funeral
director
sees
the
same
family
in
such
a
short
time
.

my
grandfather
passed
away
silently
in
his
sleep
,
and
my
grandmother
passed
away
after
a
short
struggle
with
cancer
.

both
my
grandparents
looked
as
natural
as
could
be
expected
.

thank
you
mike
for
all
your
help
professionally
and
personally
.

poor
service

if
you
like
the
drama
described
in
popular
sitcom
'
seinfeld
'
,
you
will
see
it
here
.

we
signed
our
name
in
about
6:00
pm
.

there
were
3
names
before
us
.

the
greeter
said
there
was
about
15
minutes
waiting
.

however
,
we
waited
and
waited
and
in
the
mean
time
,
saw
4
groups
of
people
simply
just
paraded
in
without
signing
there
names
.

this
sign
in
policy
is
posted
by
the
restaurant
"
no
reservation
,
sign
your
name
here
"
.

i
had
to
ask
the
greeter
,
he
explained
his
reasons
with
broken
english
.

i
could
not
understand
any
his
reasons
.

i
could
only
take
it
as
they
would
seat
the
people
they
know
first
.

my
conclusion
is
that
you
should
only
go
there
if
you
want
to
wait
a
least
an
hour
and
see
all
kinds
other
people
being
seated
before
you
.

instructor
never
showed
up
!

january
15th
--
we
were
signed
up
for
saturday
's
2
pm
class
"
beginning
yoga
with
brittany
.
"

we
even
arrived
10
minutes
early
as
the
website
suggests
.

the
instructor
did
not
show
up
!

we
waited
until
2:25
pm
and
then
left
.

there
were
2
in
our
group
,
and
a
3rd
person
was
also
in
the
parking
lot
waiting
for
this
class
.

well
,
not
much
i
can
say
except
i
'm
very
disappointed
with
this
experience
.

this
was
our
first
visit
to
your
studio
.

in
today
's
instant
world
,
there
's
no
reason
for
the
instructor
not
to
even
have
given
us
a
phone
call
or
e-mail
if
she
was
going
to
be
late
.

as
a
yoga
studio
,
i
'm
sure
you
're
all
aware
that
all
actions
generate
karma
.

and
sometimes
karma
can
manifest
itself
on
a
bad
review
on
google
.

finest
??

really
??

i
beg
to
differ
.

this
place
is
marginal
at
best
.

not
very
welcoming
and
focused
mostly
on
keeping
little
kids
entertained
.

i
was
not
impressed
,
and
quite
frustrated
at
their
lack
of
rating
for
their
courses
.

i
understand
not
wanting
to
put
labels
like
5.10
on
an
indoor
course
,
because
yes
,
it
is
not
the
same
,
but
some
clear
understanding
of
the
difficulty
of
one
course
to
another
is
nice
when
you
are
an
intermediate
climber
looking
to
improve
.

i
do
n't
want
to
waste
my
time
on
routes
set
for
children
,
but
i
do
n't
want
to
take
on
something
i
ca
n't
handle
just
to
strain
myself
to
exhaustion
.

rate
the
routes
,
with
understandable
markings
and
a
more
detailed
system
than
easy
,
moderate
,
and
hard
.

again
,
a
great
outing
for
the
kids
,
a
frustration
for
an
out
of
town
climber
.

best
dj's
in
town
!

wow
!

these
guys
were
the
best
.

they
were
thorough
,
high
class
,
and
went
above
and
beyond
.

we
never
had
to
worry
about
a
thing
,
and
they
led
the
way
the
whole
time
.

they
asked
us
things
that
we
would
have
never
have
thought
of
,
and
took
extra
time
to
meet
with
us
when
we
needed
it
before
the
wedding
.

having
a
team
was
the
best
because
they
kept
the
flow
of
the
wedding
going
the
whole
time
!

they
may
look
young
but
do
n't
let
that
fool
you
,
as
their
knowledge
of
music
far
surpassed
what
we
expected
.

i
am
a
music
junkie
that
grew
up
in
the
80's
,
and
my
dad
worked
for
a
record
label
in
the
1960's
.

so
we
did
n't
expect
them
to
even
know
some
of
the
requests
that
we
asked
that
night
.

they
just
really
know
their
stuff
!

never
fear
going
to
the
dentist
again
!

i
'm
61
years
old
and
have
dental
problems
my
entire
life
.

by
the
age
of
24
i
stopped
going
to
the
dentist
.

my
fear
and
discomfort
from
dental
work
scared
me
!

it
took
all
the
courage
i
could
muster
to
make
an
appointment
.

at
the
front
door
of
his
office
,
i
nearly
turned
around
.

i
considered
just
leaving
after
going
inside
and
nearly
did
.

doctor
gonzales
and
his
entire
staff
are
the
most
professional
people
i
have
ever
dealt
with
.

they
made
me
feel
confident
in
what
they
would
do
,
and
treated
me
like
a
member
of
their
own
family
.

i
never
felt
pain
or
discomfort
.

the
ability
to
smile
and
eat
again
can
only
be
described
as
a
whole
new
lease
on
life
.

thank
you
doctor
gonzales
,
doctor
stout
,
eva
marie
and
the
entire
staff

horrible
service
and
food

not
only
is
this
place
too
expensive
for
what
it
is
,
it
s
horrible
!

in
the
past
,
i
got
a
steak
and
there
was
more
fat
and
rough
pieces
than
there
was
good
steak
(
and
this
was
the
sirloin
!
)
,
the
sides
were
drenched
with
butter
and
the
salad
was
a
little
on
the
brown
side
.

today
we
went
for
a
party
(
during
lunch
,
so
the
place
was
empty
)
with
about
25
other
people
.

it
took
over
1.5
hours
for
our
food
to
come
out
and
by
that
time
my
8
month
old
had
it
!

does
it
seriously
take
that
long
for
a
soup
and
salad
?

i
was
a
waitress
for
years
and
a
key
rule
is
to
serve
customers
with
small
children
before
others
,
as
i
was
the
last
to
get
my
food
.

i
would
not
recommend
having
a
party
here
or
even
going
here
.

texas
roadhouse
is
way
better
!!

spay
and
neuter
service
.

i
have
no
doubt
that
the
rescue
is
wonderful
.

but
i
had
my
cat
spayed
through
their
reduced
/
free
spay
and
neuter
program
and
the
vet
they
sent
us
to
was
first
of
all
a
hour
and
a
half
away
,
and
4
days
later
we
had
to
bring
them
to
our
normal
vet
because
the
vets
at
the
place
in
wisconsin
did
a
crappy
job
and
they
got
infections
.

my
vet
even
said
it
was
not
my
fault
it
was
the
vet
that
did
the
surgery
,
so
i
would
not
recommend
getting
that
program
unless
you
have
an
extra
hundred
dollars
or
so
for
antibiotics
and
a
vet
visit
.

you
'd
think
they
would
do
a
good
job
but
they
do
n't
care
unless
they
are
getting
paid
full
price
.

which
is
so
dumb
.

not
to
mention
the
fact
that
they
gave
us
our
cats
back
not
even
30
minutes
after
they
were
out
from
surgery
.

billing
issues
...

i
had
a
routine
surgery
for
an
ingrown
toenail
.

my
insurance
company
,
blue
cross
/
blue
shield
paid
the
fees
and
everything
was
fine
.

then
i
got
a
bill
for
$
483.00
.

the
doctor
's
office
said
that
payments
had
been
"
reversed
"
.

blue
cross
has
no
record
of
aa
reversal
.

the
office
refused
my
requests
to
see
what
they
got
from
bc
/
bs
.

they
eventually
turned
it
over
to
a
collection
agency
and
now
will
not
even
discuss
the
matter
.

i
eventually
decided
to
just
pay
the
balance
even
though
the
doctor
has
already
been
paid
,
but
now
the
collection
agency
is
trying
to
say
another
reversal
of
$
160.00
has
come
through
.

it
was
an
ingrown
toenail
.

how
much
could
it
possibly
cost
?

not
only
am
i
being
bilked
for
money
i
do
not
owe
,
the
office
staff
is
rude
to
boot
.

i
think
this
office
has
some
serious
billing
practice
issues
!

we
have
been
blessed
to
find
elite
flyers
online
and
would
not
use
anyone
else
to
handle
our
postcards
,
posters
,
etc
.

we
were
looking
for
a
company
with
decent
rates
as
our
company
was
just
getting
started
.

they
have
the
best
rates
and
great
customer
service
.

on
one
order
,
we
needed
it
rushed
and
shipped
to
a
different
state
.

they
did
that
with
no
problem
.

i
also
appreciate
their
honesty
.

i
sent
a
graphic
that
would
have
been
distorted
if
printed
as
it
was
.

they
called
and
worked
with
me
to
fix
it
so
that
it
would
look
perfect
.

they
recently
surprised
me
a
larger
order
.

i
ordered
1000
postcards
,
we
normally
order
5000
or
more
.

because
they
had
room
to
do
5000
,
they
created
the
larger
amount
,
and
shipped
them
early
.

i
recommend
this
company
to
anyone
and
everyone
that
needs
great
work
done
at
a
reasonable
rate
!

they
have
a
customer
for
life
in
us
!

sheisters

i
made
the
mistake
of
buying
from
these
thieves
.

i
paid
2
k
cash
for
a
truck
with
a
blown
motor
.

their
so
called
mechanic
said
the
engine
was
good
and
"
there
is
nothing
mechanicly
wrong
with
this
truck
"
.

well
i
think
a
blown
engine
falls
under
the
catagory
of
mechanics
right
?

anyway
they
jimmy
rigged
it
so
i
could
drive
it
home
.

the
next
day
i
took
it
to
2
auto
shops
and
they
both
told
me
the
same
thing
,
engine
is
junk
.

i
called
and
got
the
same
runaround
on
hold
and
noone
calls
you
back
.

from
a
moral
standpoint
,
you
guys
are
really
gon
na
take
2,000
bucks
from
someone
that
needs
that
truck
to
work
and
support
his
family
when
you
know
it
s
just
a
piece
of
scrap
metal
?

if
it
lasted
1
month
i
could
suck
it
up
but
1
day
?

grimy
work
you
guys
do
.

kids

just

few
days

it
is
right

some
might
miss
it
as
it
is

i
popped
in
after
my

it

filled
with
lots

to

watch
out

your
wallet

this
company
is
overpriced
for
their
services
.

they
pride
themselves
on
being
an
event
and
team
building
company
for
corporate
clients
but
you
better
believe
they
are
going
to
mark
you
up
on
that
feel
good
premise
.

on
a
recent
event
quote
that
i
had
done
,
they
came
in
thousands
of
dollars
over
their
local
competition
.

the
craziest
part
is
that
they
are
n't
even
based
locally
at
the
city
i
'm
in
-
they
just
have
'
teams
'
in
areas
through
the
country
.

i
've
spoken
to
vendors
who
are
used
by
them
who
had
nothing
good
to
say
about
the
company
as
well
and
in
fact
were
afraid
to
quote
events
against
them
even
though
they
openly
admitted
that
they
felt
canadian
outback
was
pricing
their
entertainment
out
of
the
market
and
doing
more
to
hurt
their
business
than
help
them
.

be
warned
-
they
'll
ltake
you
for
everything
they
can
.

me

orr
's
a
nightmare
!

do
n't
go
!

my
boyfriend
and
i
were
woken
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
at
our
campsite
by
drunken
kids
who
'd
arrived
around
1:00
am
and
were
drinking
at
the
springs
.

when
we
complained
to
the
management
(
as
we
were
instructed
to
do
if
there
were
any
problems
)
,
nothing
happened
!

then
,
the
next
morning
,
when
we
,
among
many
other
irate
guests
,
asked
to
speak
to
the
owner
,
he
refused
to
do
so
.

not
only
that
,
but
he
told
us
,
via
his
manager
,
that
it
was
our
responsibility
to
get
up
a
second
time
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
call
the
night
staff
if
the
problem
continued
,
even
though
his
manager
did
nothing
the
first
time
to
stop
the
kids
.

orr
is
not
relaxing
,
it
's
not
a
safe
space
,
and
the
owner
is
awful
.

to
add
insult
to
injury
,
he
refused
to
refund
our
money
.

do
n't
go
!

fhs
is
a
good
high
school
--
c
/
o
1998

i
enjoyed
my
time
at
franklin
high
school
.

we
had
relatively
good
facilities
at
the
time
--
decent
science
labs
,
with
multiple
hoods
and
access
to
good
equipment
;
nice
gymnasiums
,
and
a
well
-
funded
music
department
(
i
was
in
the
guitar
ensemble
)
.

now
,
of
course
,
there
's
a
new
building
,
with
presumably
better
facilities
.

all
to
the
good
.

for
those
who
care
,
a
good
proportion
of
the
my
class
went
on
to

,
many
of
them
ranked

i
remember
,
students
went
to
dartmouth
,
u.
penn
,
duke
,
bu
,
william
and
mary
,
vassar
,
howard
,
and
carnegie
mellon
,
among
others
.

many
students
went
to
rutgers
,
including
their
top
-
ranked
pharmacy
program
.

the
point
is
--
fhs
gives
you
the
opportunity
to
make
it
to
a
good
college
,
but
you
need
to
work
hard
.

absolutely
the
best
little
motel
on
the
coast
!

i
've
stayed
at
this
fabulous
little
motel
two
years
running
,
and
i
have
to
say
it
's
one
of
the
best
lodging
experiences
i
've
ever
had
on
the
coast
...
and
i
'm
even
comparing
it
to
the
big
resorts
i
've
stayed
at
!

a
large
group
of
my
friends
and
i
rent
almost
the
whole
motel
every
year
for
a
weekend
,
and
the
experience
and
stay
have
always
been
five
-
star
.

the
rooms
are
so
clean
,
the
managers
/
owners
are
the
nicest
people
,
the
place
feels
so
homey
,
and
the
location
and
grounds
are
beautiful
.

there
's
a
restaurant
nearby
(
walking
distance
)
with
a
great
breakfast
,
and
a
market
across
the
street
.

the
motel
is
very
well
maintained
,
and
the
managers
are
so
accomodating
,
it
's
kind
of
like
visiting
family
each
year
!
;-)

i
honestly
ca
n't
rave
enough
about
this
place
...
it
's
really
a
hidden
gem
worth
checking
out
!

my
favorite
cuban
cafe
in
orlando

i
have
been
eating
cuban
for
a
long
time
,
sandwiches
mainly
along
with
other
dishes
..

i
love
cuban
coffee
,
colada
...
mmmm
anyways
i
found
this
place
and
ca
n't
stop
going
there
,
i
stop
in
at
least
once
a
week
and
anytime
i
'm
in
the
area
for
a
cuban
coffee
or
snack
.

the
place
is
chill
and
comfortable
.

they
do
n't
speak
the
best
english
but
enough
to
get
by
.

they
bake
bread
fresh
daily
,
they
do
n't
press
their
sandwiches
which
is
the
way
i
like
it
,
and
the
meat
is
always
fresh
.

they
have
a
great
lunch
special
with
your
choice
of
meat
,
chicken
,
steak
,
or
pork
and
rice
and
black
beans
and
fried
plantains
.

and
their
breakfast
is
awesome
!!

i
can
not
describe
how
delicious
the
mango
and
cheese
pastries
and
the
omelets
are
to
die
for
.

stop
in
and
have
a
bite
you
wo
n't
regret
it
.

a
slice
of
heaven
in
winter
park
off
forsyth
!

highly
recommended
.

i
have
been
going
to
warner
family
for
a
number
of
years
and
would
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
.

i
've
read
some
of
the
reviews
below
and
would
like
to
state
that
yes
,
like
any
other
doctor
s
office
there
is
sometimes
a
wait
(
depending
on
what
other
patients
are
being
seen
for
)
and
some
of
the
tests
and
procedures
that
are
ran
can
be
costly
(
just
like
they
would
be
for
any
other
medical
tests
elsewhere
if
you
do
not
have
insurance
)
...

i
have
seen
several
of
the
providers
from
the
office
and
have
not
once
been
shown
anything
but
care
and
consideration
.

i
ca
nt
speak
for
them
but
any
tests
or
appointments
they
recommend
are
probably
in
the
best
interests
of
us
(
the
patient
)
and
you
have
the
ability
to
decline
anything
that
they
suggest
to
you
.

i
personally
have
had
wonderful
service
and
if
you
re
truely
looking
for
a
family
practice
...
warner
family
is
the
place
for
you
.

not
what
i
expected
!

we
read
the
good
reviews
before
going
and
had
high
hopes
..
but
to
our
dismay
it
did
nt
turn
out
that
way
!

~
it
took
over
40
mins
to
be
taken
to
our
table
,
once
there
it
took
another
20
mins
to
get
our
orders
and
a
further
45
mins
till
our
starters
landed
on
our
table
.

very
frustrating
for
a
restaurant
that
has
1
rosette
and
is
supposedly
renowned
for
the
service
...
hmm
there
was
no
canape's
or
amuse
to
keep
us
occupied
,
once
we
complained
about
the
wait
they
took
us
something
to
nibble
on
but
that
took
us
getting
out
our
chairs
and
wondering
round
to
do
that
and
it
was
impossible
to
get
anyone
s
attention
.

scallops
were
overcooked
and
the
foie
gras
was
cold
but
the
rest
of
the
food
was
lovely
.

on
top
of
that
though
they
tried
to
charge
us
service
charge
just
to
rub
it
it
....

would
n't
go
back
as
there
are
a
lot
of
places
a
lot
better
and
cheaper
.

nice
selection
,
very
clean
,
friendly
staff
!

hot
iron
has
become
a
favorite
of
our
family
.

everyone
can
get
the
signature
dish
with
ingredients
and
spices
that
they
want
and
have
the
fun
of
watching
it
cook
.

the
staff
are
very
friendly
and
conscientious
.

they
always
ask
if
you
have
meat
in
your
dish
,
(
for
vegetarians
like
me
)
,
they
scrub
an
area
of
the
grill
and
use
separate
utensils
to
cook
.

they
do
n't
just
dump
your
ingredients
on
and
cook
either
,
but
carefully
separate
meat
to
the
hotter
parts
of
the
grill
and
still
manage
to
keep
the
veggies
from
turning
to
mush
.

the
selection
of
meats
,
veggies
and
sauces
is
awesome
too
!

every
time
we
go
they
seem
to
have
a
different
ingredient
or
two
which
keeps
things
interesting
.

meats
are
kept
very
cold
,
seafood
smells
fresh
and
the
serving
bar
is
very
clean
.

prices
are
reasonable
,
(
kid
s
meals
are
around
4.99
)
and
wednesday's
they
have
discount
dinner
prices
,
i
believe
.

great
cookies
,
cakes
,
and
customer
service

it
was
my
birthday
and
i
had
a
last
minute
idea
to
have
a
bakery
cake
instead
of
one
pre-made
in
a
convenience
store
,
but
the
problem
was
it
was
the
day
before
valentine
s
and
when
many
bakeries
turned
me
down
for
a
plain
vanilla
rectangle
cake
,
fiona
stepped
up
to
the
plate
and
was
able
to
make
a
fantastic
beautiful
cake
.

not
only
did
it
taste
wonderful
,
but
the
texture
was
unbelievable
,
the
frosting
was
n't
overly
sweet
to
over
power
the
cake
,
and
the
cake
itself
was
just
amazingly
soft
,
and
fluffy
,
and
just
perfect
overall
.

although
i
'll
have
to
drive
a
little
out
of
my
way
to
go
there
,
i
'll
gladly
do
it
knowing
that
since
she
's
been
astounding
to
me
once
before
that
she
'll
always
be
that
way
!

(
also
she
has
a
really
great
website
!

and
we
bought
a
few
cookies
there
too
,
they
were
fantastic
as
well
!
)

she
deserves
many
5
star
reviews
!!

food
craving
gone
and
weight
loss
at
acupuncture
doctor

i
am
a
college
student
.

before
treatment
,
my
food
cravings
were
"
out
of
control
"
which
caused
me
to
be
stressed
out
.

i
experienced
a
definite
decrease
in
food
craving
(
about
50
%
)
and
decrease
in
stress
after
the
1st
treatment
.

i
actually
loss
4
pounds
after
my
1st
treatment
and
2
pounds
after
my
2nd
treatment
.

i
was
amazed
.

i
am
now
more
at
peace
and
my
food
craving
is
about
99
%
gone
after
only
3
treatments
.

before
coming
to
acupuncture
doctor
i
was
a
big
baby
about
needles
and
only
came
because
my
boyfriend
's
aunt
recommended
it
.

it
hurt
very
little
,
felt
more
like
pressure
than
pain
.

what
i
like
most
about
dr.
liau
is
that
she
is
very
caring
.

she
talks
to
you
at
each
appointment
.

i
can
tell
she
really
cares
and
wants
to
help
.

i
am
so
glad
to
have
found
dr.
liau
.

now
i
feel
more
confident
wearing
my
bathing
suit
in
the
summer
.

an
asset
to
richmond

for
a
long
time
,
one
big
source
of
entertainment
missing
from
the
richmond
city
limits
was
a
first
-
run
multiplex
.

bowtie
has
filled
that
role
nicely
.

the
theatre
is
in
an
old
brick
warehouse
,
which
is
a
block
away
from
the
flying
squirrels
stadium
.

the
owners
of
bowtie
manged
to
add
something
new
while
preserving
what
was
already
there
.

the
theatre
has
greatly
improved
the
surrounding
neighborhood
.

there
's
plenty
of
parking
,
and
i
've
never
had
an
issue
with
audience
members
who
wo
n't
stop
talking
or
answering
their
cellphones
.

best
of
all
,
there
are
no
ads
!!!!
!

just
previews
and
the
main
feature
.

expect
to
pay
full
price
,
and
the
theatres
themselves
are
on
the
small
side
.

but
if
you
like
going
to
the
movies
,
you
should
love
bowtie
.

the
mangers
also
play
a
classic
movies
on
sundays
,
you
can
get
a
beer
in
the
lobby
,
and
repeat
customers
can
get
discounts
if
they
have
a
member
card
.

a
great
cinema
in
a
great
location
.

thank
you
,
bowtie
!

craft
wonderland
with
history

my
first
visit
was
so
fun
yesterday
.

i
could
have
stayed
all
day
and
not
seen
all
the
things
.

i
am
doing
origami
jewelry
and
found
exactly
the
right
things
for
earrings
and
got
many
other
ideas
there
too
.

i
bought
a
beginner
s
quilling
set
and
like
making
the
filigree
forms
you
can
make
and
add
to
other
crafts
.

the
owner
,
jean
,
has
been
there
31
years
!

what
a
history
.

she
is
a
super
sweet
,
lovable
and
well
-
informed
woman
with
a
great
sense
of
humor
.

i
really
enjoyed
meeting
her
and
happy
to
learn
she
comes
from
oklahoma
and
has
the
values
of
a
solid
no
bs
country
girl
.

this
store
is
a
real
gem
and
has
much
to
offer
the
serious
crafter
or
the
occasional
crafter
.

by
the
way
,
salmagundi
(
the
store
name
)
means
something
like
smorgasbord
;
potpourri
;
motley
;
variety
;
mixed
bag
;
miscellaneous
assortment
;
mixture
,
a
variety
of
many
kinds
of
things
.

great
name
for
a
great
store

the
2010
genesis
is
grrrrrrrreeeaaat
!

i
am
a
proud
owner
of
a
brand
new
2010
hyundai
genesis
.

i
have
never
seen
this
car
before
until
this
lady
at
wal
mart
had
it
and
she
told
me
she
got
it
here
and
that
everyone
was
so
nice
to
her
.

i
asked
her
who
she
worked
with
and
she
just
told
me
ti
was
the
sales
manager
.

i
took
the
weekend
off
and
came
in
and
asked
for
the
manager
who
is
jeff
and
he
remembered
her
right
away
even
remembered
her
dog
,
i
was
a
bit
shocked
that
someone
would
pay
that
close
attention
.

we
got
to
talking
and
he
got
me
set
up
and
i
test
drove
with
craig
and
i
fell
head
over
heels
for
this
car
all
i
kept
saying
,
"
was
i
got
ta
have
it
!
"

i
thouhgt
it
would
be
out
of
my
price
range
but
they
really
worked
with
me
and
now
i
could
nt
be
happier
.

jeff
and
craig
are
really
good
at
what
they
do
and
know
exactly
how
to
treat
a
customer
.

definitely
go
see
them
!

bait
and
switch
,
untrained
workers

called
the
bonanza
store
2
weeks
ago
,
before
i
ripped
out
350
sq
ft
of
ceramic
tile
...
was
told
i
would
need
a
"
dual
head
concrete
grinder
"
to
remove
thinset
and
make
a
nice
"
finished
"
look
(
ready
for
concrete
stain
)
.

was
quoted
$
55
all
inclusive
of
grinder
inserts
,
etc
.

no
problem
,
sounded
like
it
's
done
every
day
.

will
look
beautiful
.

got
the
tile
ripped
out
,
call
today
,
now
all
the
sudden
this
grinder
wo
n't
leave
a
finished
look
and
it
's
$
125
plus
around
$
75
for
the
inserts
.

i
can
rent
another
machine
for
like
$
60
that
will
give
it
a
finished
look
.

so
from
$
55
to
$
260
?

are
they
serious
?

i
feel
like
they
did
n't
tell
me
the
pitfalls
before
i
pulled
out
this
tile
and
now
that
i
have
no
other
options
they
want
5
times
the
price
?

either
these
people
do
n't
know
anything
about
what
they
are
renting
,
or
worse
-
they
are
bait
and
switching
.

one
suspects
that
earlier
reviewer
works
for
another
laundry
.

outside
of
parking
being
at
a
premium
,
especially
on
discount
days
,
the
laundry
tub
is
not
filthy
and
it
's
no
smaller
than
any
of
a
dozen
laundromats
i
've
been
in
.

yes
,
there
are
bigger
,
but
bigger
is
n't
necessarily
better
.

i
availed
myself
of
the
wash
'n
fold
service
,
taking
just
about
a
year
's
worth
of
dirty
clothes
in
and
getting
back
neatly
folded
,
clean
clothes
in
clear
plastic
bags
(
i
'd
originally
brought
them
in
,
in
six
large
yellow
garbage
bags
)
.

the
cost
was
certainly
reasonable
and
i
will
continue
my
patronage
of
the
laundry
tub
in
the
future
.

did
n't
hurt
any
that
they
knew
my
name
by
my
second
visit
and
greeted
me
warmly
then
and
on
my
third
visit
.

whereas
my
answer
to
the
question
"
where
do
you
get
your
laundry
done
?
"
used
to
be
,
"
at
the
checkout
line
at
walmart
,
"
i
can
honestly
say
the
answer
now
is
,
"
at
the
laundry
tub
.
"

thank
you
!

i
recently
took
a
rescue
puppy
to
this
clinic
and
i
was
shocked
at
how
well
romeo
and
my
family
was
treated
.

they
worked
around
the
clock
to
ensure
that
my
puppy
life
was
saved
.

we
have
to
leave
him
at
the
vet
for
3
days
and
i
was
told
to
call
for
check
ups
as
often
as
i
wished
that
no
matter
how
many
times
i
called
i
would
not
annoy
them
.

lol
they
where
super
friendly
towards
us
and
treated
us
like
people
not
walking
bags
of
cash
.

in
this
day
it
s
rare
to
find
such
wonderful
people
who
care
,
not
the
kind
of
want
to
make
cash
.

i
would
strongly
suggest
you
give
them
the
chance
to
prove
to
you
that
not
all
people
in
this
world
are
evil
!

i
will
never
go
to
another
vet
as
long
as
i
have
animals
.

i
live
nearly
two
hours
away
and
yet
i
will
still
make
the
drive
to
see
them
!

in
fact
i
look
forward
to
taking
my
animals
to
the
vet
simply
because
of
how
my
animals
and
i
are
treated
.

okay
,
here
's
the
scoop
.

i
'm
a
regular
at
the
hh
.

the
food
is
excellent
,
the
serivce
is
horrible
.

i
think
they
're
still
in
the
mindset
from
when
it
was
only
smokers
sitting
around
and
drinking
...
not
in
any
hurry
.

in
my
experience
the
food
has
been
excellent
(
for
the
most
part
)
.

however
,
the
bartenders
/
waitresses
definately
need
to
be
re-trained
(
if
they
ever
had
any
to
begin
with
)
and
learn
two
things
:
only
chat
with
customers
when
other
customers
are
not
impatiently
waiting
and
to
look
around
more
often
to
see
if
people
are
waiting
.

in
some
cases
the
result
is
because
of
understaffing
,
in
some
cases
the
staff
just
does
n't
care
/
know
better
.

they
must
also
get
something
to
keep
take
-
out
warm
,
so
it
's
not
room
temperature
at
best
when
you
get
it
home
.

you
just
have
to
know
what
you
're
getting
into
when
you
go
.

nice
local
pub
,
excellent
food
(
especially
wings
)
,
and
do
n't
go
if
you
have
a
limited
amount
of
time
.

trust
the
midas
touch

i
personally
trust
this
midas
store
with
all
my
vehicles
,
i
have
been
going
there
for
years
&
would
never
go
anywhere
else
!

the
staff
is
very
personable
&
actually
care
about
the
customers
safety
rather
than
taking
there
money
.

this
is
however
a
very
busy
shop
but
there
are
appointments
available
&
the
staff
up
front
will
surely
make
sure
you
get
back
in
a
timely
manner
.

i
look
at
some
of
these
other
comments
&
laugh
because
people
think
that
the
world
revolves
around
them
!

like
the
girl
with
the
fuse
problem
...

midas
has
the
most
high
tech
equipment
in
town
&
i
guarantee
you
if
they
told
you
it
was
electrical
then
in
deed
it
s
electrical
!

maybe
you
should
understand
how
the
world
works
&
realize
you
are
just
like
any
other
person
&
not
put
yourself
on
a
pedestal
.

i
will
continue
going
to
dave
at
midas
because
he
is
one
of
the
most
honest
business
owners
in
this
town
!

when
having
your
car
worked
on
you
have
to
trust
the
mechanic
&
this
midas
is
truly
someone
you
can
trust
!

we
decided
to
try
this
place
last
night
because
we
noticed
that
it
had
some
interesting
things
on
the
menu
aside
from
the
usual
rolls
--
live
scallop
sashimi
,
duck
breast
nigiri
with
foie
gras
,
panko
mussels
--
but
none
of
these
were
particularly
great
or
worth
the
sticker
price
.

additionally
we
tried
the
logan
circle
roll
,
spicy
crab
and
tuna
roll
,
and
sweet
potato
tempura
roll
(
$
15
,
$
10
,
and
$
3.75
respectively
)
.

the
sweet
potato
tempura
roll
was
actually
a
great
surprise
:
cheap
and
delicious
,
the
only
thing
we
tried
that
i
would
say
was
well
worth
it
and
a
great
value
(
and
i
never
get
vegetarian
rolls
)
.

the
other
rolls
were
n't
at
all
special
,
especially
given
their
pricing
.

the
bottom
line
is
that
the
food
is
n't
great
and
is
relatively
high
-
priced
.

the
service
is
solicitous
,
the
atmosphere
is
nice
and
mod
except
the
out
-
of
-
place
flat
-
screen
tv
playing
football
.

but
i
'd
go
elsewhere
unless
the
prices
are
cut
.

it
's
just
not
worth
it
.

do
n't
expect
sleep
or
courtesy

i
was
booked
for
2
nights
at
this
hotel
in
oct
2007
.

at
3:15
am
on
night
2
,
the
fire
alarm
and
strobe
light
activated
in
my
room
.

these
are
not
household
type
alarms
.

when
they
sound
off
,
it
is
a
true
audio
/
visual
experience
.

i
called
the
front
desk
and
got
no
answer
.

after
checking
for
signs
of
fire
or
smoke
and
seeing
none
,
i
decided
to
just
pack
up
and
leave
.

the
desk
agent
actually
argued
with
me
,
claiming
that
no
such
alarm
had
gone
off
(
as
if
i
would
make
that
up
?
)
.

he
finally
admitted
that
only
the
4
ada
room
alarms
had
sounded
,
so
only
4
guests
were
effected
(
no
big
deal
to
him
)
.

this
little
drip
offered
no
apologies
whatsoever
,
and
even
refused
to
give
me
the
name
of
the
manager
until
i
pressed
him
for
it
3
times
.

this
hotel
is
adequate
enough
,
but
there
is
an
obvious
problem
with
the
staff
and
management
.

do
not
go
there
if
you
expect
to
sleep
through
the
night
.

poor
service
,
lack
of
passion
:
do
not
go

i
began
seeing
dr.
romanick
back
in
2000
and
have
seen
a
significant
decline
in
the
quality
of
care
,
patient
-
doctor
communication
,
and
just
the
overall
level
of
services
.

the
poor
quality
starts
at
the
receptionist
desk
,
where
the
staff
is
very
impatient
and
lack
the
efficiency
i
once
loved
about
the
office
.

it
took
them
nearly
two
months
to
complete
a
simple
task
,
and
countless
calls
from
my
part
due
to
their
lack
of
response
and
passion
(
not
that
it
's
a
requirement
for
the
job
,
but
it
helps
to
at
least
pretend
to
be
helpful
)
.

also
,
i
was
promised
to
have
my
test
results
emailed
to
me
,
but
it
never
happened
,
and
after
a
few
attempts
to
get
dr.
romanick
on
the
phone
to
brief
me
on
my
condition
,
i
finally
gave
up
and
went
to
a
different
doctor
.

please
do
not
go
there
if
it
's
professional
,
friendly
,
diligent
medical
services
you
're
looking
for
.

save
yourself
the
trouble
,
money
and
time
and
visit
a
more
caring
facility
/
doctor
.

the
moving
company
is
actualy
based
in
brooklyn
,
but
advertised
all
over
ny
/
nj
,
including
fort
lee
.

when
the
guys
arrived
(
2
hours
later
than
agreed
)
they
told
that
you
have
to
pay
all
the
tolls
they
payed
coming
from
brooklyn
and
extra
$
100
for
them
to
drive
back
from
your
destination
.

that
was
not
in
agreement
eather
,
but
they
realy
demand
it
.

and
another
$
100
for
wrapping
the
furniture
.

so
totalling
$
212
just
for
start
before
any
work
started
.

guess
what
,
was
not
in
the
initial
agreement
as
well
.

i
was
moving
out
from
2
bdr
apartment
and
it
took
for
3
strong
guys
6
hours
to
load
a
track
(
from
2
pm
-
8
pm
)
.

the
only
reason
i
'm
giving
3
stars
instead
of
1
or
2
,
i
should
admit
,
nothing
was
broken
.

so
i
still
can
recomend
them
but
prepare
pay
twice
as
much
as
they
tell
you
initially
.

one
more
thing
,
they
do
n't
take
any
credit
cards
or
checks
.

you
have
to
pay
cash
only
before
they
start
unloading
track
on
your
destination
.

worst
apartments
ever

we
lived
here
for
2
years
,
the
first
year
or
so
was
okay
.

then
,
the
more
power
they
gave
to
linda
,
the
worse
the
place
got
.

we
were
always
having
our
water
shut
off
,
there
were
always
people
having
parties
at
the
pool
,
even
after
it
was
supposed
to
be
closed
.

the
pool
was
supposed
to
close
at
10
and
they
would
have
people
down
there
until
11:45
yelling
,
playing
music
and
do
who
-
knows
-
what
in
the
dark
corners
of
the
pool
.

then
,
when
we
moved
out
,
we
cleaned
the
apartment
top
to
bottom
,
they
came
back
and
tried
to
charge
us
for
two
cleaning
fees
(
and
we
never
got
our
deposit
back
)
and
past
utilities
(
that
were
already
paid
,
we
have
check
numbers
and
records
of
this
)
.

linda
is
the
rudest
person
you
will
ever
talk
to
and
she
sticks
up
for
all
of
the
trashy
,
rude
people
that
live
there
,
not
the
nice
ones
that
actually
give
a
crap
about
respecting
others
.

do
not
live
here
,
you
will
regret
it
!

the
worst
experience
ever
!!!

i
have
worked
with
ted
jurek
at
decor
and
you
,
and
it
started
out
as
a
decent
experience
.

he
was
referred
to
me
by
a
friend
,
who
did
n't
have
the
best
experience
with
ted
,
but
said
that
ted
was
able
to
make
up
for
his
lack
of
preparedness
at
the
end
.

i
figure
i
would
give
this
company
a
chance
.

however
,
after
giving
a
required
$
500.00
(
non
refundable
)
deposit
before
seeing
any
plans
or
ideas
,
i
was
sorry
i
did
.

we
met
a
couple
of
weeks
later
,
ted
was
late
.

he
brought
fabric
books
,
and
pictures
of
furniture
only
,
which
all
came
way
over
budget
.

by
the
time
we
got
to
the
budget
i
told
him
i
could
work
with
,
there
was
basically
no
design
.

just
curtains
and
a
couple
of
accessories
.

what
is
that
?????

this
company
is
way
too
expensive
with
nothing
to
show
for
it
.

please
everyone
....
take
heed
and
do
n't
get
caught
up
in
the
hype
about
decor
and
you
working
with
every
budget
...

this
is
just
a
way
for
them
to
squirm
their
way
into
your
precious
pocket

horrible
.

horrible
.

when
we
walked
in
,
the
person
behind
desk
said
:
"
oh
well
,
you
must
wait
,
i
am
in
the
middle
of
something
.
"

after
a
good
few
minutes
,
he
asked
:
"
what
do
you
want
?
"

somewhere
in
between
his
rudeness
he
asked
if
we
smoked
.

i
asked
if
this
hotel
had
smoking
rooms
.

he
immediately
said
"
no
,
there
is
a
$
50
deposit
now
!
"

sure
enough
he
charged
it
to
the
credit
card
.

when
i
inquired
he
rudely
replied
"
in
the
morning
when
things
are
checked
out
you
'll
get
it
back
.
"

i
called
customer
service
about
it
because
the
website
specifically
states
that
there
are
no
other
charges
at
the
check
-
in
.

i
also
mentioned
to
the
reception
person
.

he
responded
"
we
have
problem
with
'
people
'
"
.

imagine
a
hotel
having
problems
with
people
.

i
finally
alerted
him
to
his
rudeness
.

he
said
he
's
had
a
long
and
bad
day
.

we
had
no
choice
but
to
stay
but
will
take
this
as
far
as
we
can
.

do
n't
stay
there
.

i
came
to
find
out
the
person
was
the
hotel
owner
also
.

my
friend
and
i
were
to
stay
here
for
a
girls
night
,
catch
up
on
our
lives
evening
.

we
live
within
20
miles
of
the
hotel
and
wanted
to
get
away
from
our
responsibilities
for
the
night
.

unfortunalty
my
husband
and
i
had
to
put
our
13
year
old
lab
down
that
morning
and
we
were
not
expecting
this
.

my
friend
called
the
hotel
to
cancel
our
room
as
soon
as
i
called
her
.

they
said
that
we
were
to
be
charged
for
this
room
regardless
because
we
did
not
cancel
within
the
72
hours
.

i
called
them
back
a
few
hours
after
putting
my
bodhi
down
and
they
still
would
n't
budge
.

times
are
hard
,
i
know
,
but
they
had
no
compassion
.

i
called
3
times
to
talked
to
a
manager
,
never
a
call
back
.

i
emailed
4
times
,
never
a
response
.

in
one
of
the
emails
i
attached
the
letter
from
the
vet
's
that
expressed
their
sympathy
,
this
hotel
did
nothing
.

i
even
emailed
mackinaw
tourist
and
nothing
.

i
am
sure
this
is
a
good
place
to
stay
from
reading
the
other
reviews
,
but
if
something
unexpected
happens
in
your
life
,
they
will
not
care
.

fanfuckingtastic

ok
i
am
a
new
yorker
who
has
been
going
to
school
in
oxford
,
england
.

i
thought
the
uk
was
completely
devoid
of
good
nyc
style
pizza
.

i
thought
to
get
a
decent
pizza
the
only
way
was
at
a
fancy
restaurant
,
and
i
have
to
get
a
whole
pie
.

i
thought
i
would
have
to
wait
until
i
went
home
to
nyc
.

well
then
i
went
on
a
trip
to
glasgow
and
was
walking
around
.

i
saw
this
place
and
it
looked
like
the
holy
grail
.

i
knew
i
had
found
the
real
deal
,
big
pies
,
sold
by
the
slice
,
with
the
pizzas
sitting
under
the
glass
in
the
front
.

they
have
crushed
red
pepper
flakes
and
oregano
.

so
i
ordered
a
slice
.

it
tasted
like
i
just
flew
back
home
.

i
du
n
no
how
they
did
it
,
but
scottish
friends
---
this
is
the
real
deal
.

i
congratulated
this
establishment
for
doing
the
research
on
making
nyc
pizza
because
these
scots
fcking
nailed
it
.

that
being
said
,
i
do
n't
know
how
their
delivery
service
is
.

they
might
want
to
change
the
name
to
reflect
the
new
yorkedness
of
the
pizza
,
scrummy
yummy
sounds
gimmicky
to
me
.

good
food
,
good
wait
staff
,
poor
management

we
visited
on
7/26/08
for
dinner
we
received
a
gift
certificate
for
the
mama
mia
's
on
greenfield
ave
.

the
food
was
good
,
and
so
was
our
waitress
.

when
it
came
time
to
pay
the
bill
up
front
,
they
would
not
let
me
use
any
of
the
certificate
for
a
tip
(
which
i
have
done
with
any
other
restaurant
i
've
gotten
a
gift
certificate
for
.
)

i
then
asked
if
i
could
have
money
back
in
cash
.

the
person
went
to
go
check
with
the
manager
,
who
was
sitting
at
a
table
chatting
with
her
friends
who
were
eating
there
.

her
answer
was
short
and
manner
rather
rude
.

sorry
for
interrupting
i
guess
.

the
cashier
was
also
short
,
unapologetic
and
made
me
feel
as
i
was
wasting
her
time
.

there
were
no
other
options
available
(
i
only
brought
my
check
card
to
cover
any
overage
cost
)
and
she
rang
it
up
and
applied
it
to
the
gift
card
before
telling
me
about
the
tip
policy
.

i
will
not
be
visiting
mama
mia
's
again
.

there
are
other
places
with
food
just
as
good
with
management
that
values
customers
and
employees
much
more
.

dining
at
texas
roadhouse

texas
roadhouse
has
very
good
meals
,
that
the
meat
comes
right
off
the
bones
.

it
has
very
good
prices
.

on
a
bad
note
the
waiting
area
is
not
enjoyable
or
enough
seats
.

also
,
there
should
not
be
peanuts
all
over
the
floor
.

next
,
there
should
only
be
one
person
bringing
you
your
food
.

it
s
not
a
big
deal
but
i
had
to
take
my
salad
home
because
they
forgot
to
bring
it
.

i
had
to
ask
the
girl
who
brought
my
food
and
she
never
came
back
to
let
me
know
.

i
had
to
wait
for
my
waitress
.

when
you
first
come
in
the
hostess
is
not
very
friendly
,
there
is
just
a
bunch
of
workers
standing
there
.

i
was
there
on
march
6th
,
2009
.

i
was
also
there
of
july
4th
2008
,
when
my
daughter
s
buffalo
wings
came
out
with
a
fly
on
it
.

the
manager
came
over
and
said
he
was
sorry
and
gave
a
new
batch
of
wings
,
he
said
we
ca
nt
really
do
anything
because
the
doors
are
always
opening
and
closing
.

in
my
opinion
should
of
just
took
off
the
price
of
the
wings
from
the
bill
.

but
everyone
has
there
own
way
!!!!!!

mezza
luna
ftw
!

their
mezza
luna's
are
deffly
better
than
the
pizza
rolls
.

it
s
like
a
pizza
roll
,
but
they
just
toss
ham
and
cheese
inside
.

it
seems
like
it
s
healthier
too
,
but
it
s
prolly
not
.

also
,
you
can
call
em
ahead
of
time
,
and
then
go
to
pick
up
ur
food
,
or
have
it
delivered
**
.

that
cuts
down
on
teh
wait
time
,
cus
u
can
do
other
stuff
while
u
r
waiting
.

it
usually
takes
20
mins
for
a
mezza
luna
,
as
they
have
to
add
pure
delicious
extract
to
the
mix
.

their
pizza
was
a
little
salty
for
me
,
but
it
s
still
good
.

they
do
that
whole
thing
where
you
sandwich
the
pepperoni
between
layers
of
cheese
for
+
32
delicious
.

anyways
,
the
mezza
luna
:
you
should
try
it
.

it
runs
you
about
4
bucks
and
it
deals
crushing
blows
to
hunger
.

**
edit
:
living
on
campus
at
clarkson
university
,
i
have
had
food
delivered
before
.

this
was
back
between
'05
and
'09
and
i
do
n't
remember
how
many
times
we
've
had
it
delivered
.

perhaps
they
do
n't
deliver
anymore
,
but
the
deliciousness
of
a
mezza
luna
certainly
warrants
a
pickup
.

my
2004
x
-
type
was
getting
close
to
100,000
miles
so
it
was
time
for
an
upgrade
.

i
sent
my
wife
and
daughter
over
to
check
out
a
pre-owned
2009
xf
.

michael
chestney
was
very
pleasant
and
patient
with
my
wife
and
she
suggested
i
go
check
it
out
.

i
went
in
later
that
afternoon
and
met
with
michael
.

he
showed
me
the
car
i
was
interested
in
and
we
took
a
test
drive
.

i
loved
the
car
so
we
began
negotiating
my
trade
-
in
and
the
price
of
the
09
xf
.

the
entire
negotiation
took
about
20
minutes
.

fair
give
and
take
on
both
sides
until
we
agreed
on
a
deal
that
was
within
my
parameters
and
was
fair
to
both
sides
.

10
minutes
of
paperwork
and
i
was
the
owner
of
a
beautiful
pre-owned
09
xf
.

i
have
purchased
over
15
vehicles
(
cars
,
rvs
,
and
boats
)
in
my
lifetime
and
i
have
to
say
the
experience
with
michael
and
barrett
motor
cars
of
san
antonio
was
one
of
the
best
.

friendly
,
knowledgeable
,
and
above
all
fair
.

that
's
all
you
can
really
ask
from
a
car
dealer
and
michael
and
barrett
hit
all
3
.

thanks
for
the
great
deal
and
the
great
car
!

identity
theft

myself
and
my
fiance
's
identity
was
stolen
from
the
office
staff
.

we
were
told
by
a
detective
and
asked
to
check
our
credit
for
anything
unusual
.

luckily
they
caught
the
crooks
before
they
did
one
on
us
.

it
was
a
black
female
that
use
to
work
in
the
office
.

she
stole
the
information
and
gave
it
to
another
guy
that
did
all
the
work
.

the
other
guy
was
pulled
over
one
day
and
a
cop
saw
suspicious
papers
with
names
and
social
security
numbers
on
it
.

that
s
how
they
were
caught
.

they
both
went
to
jail
and
a
new
manager
was
put
in
charge
of
the
apartments
.

the
apartment
across
from
mine
belonged
to
a
gang
of
hookers
.

nobody
lived
there
.

a
girl
would
show
up
,
then
a
guy
in
a
nice
car
would
show
up
.

short
time
later
the
guy
would
leave
,
then
the
girl
.

my
apartment
was
usually
quiet
.

i
lived
in
one
that
did
not
face
the
parking
lot
.

parking
spaces
are
just
big
enough
for
a
mini
cooper
.

it
sucked
having
an
suv
.

if
i
found
a
spot
,
i
could
nt
fit
in
it
.

gates
worked
30
%
of
the
time
at
best
.

bugs
were
a
small
problem
,
nothing
too
bad
.

the
best
there
is
in
service
.

i
was
recently
traveling
down
i
-
24
from
nashville
with
my
3
young
children
and
had
a
blowout
on
the
southeast
side
of
murfreesboro
.

it
was
4:50
when
a
friend
told
me
to
call
bud
,
he
would
take
care
of
me
.

not
only
did
they
answer
the
phone
at
4:50
on
a
thursday
,
they
hit
the
ground
moving
!.

they
tracked
down
the
only
tire
that
fit
my
bmw
330i
in
murfreesboro
within
minutes
and
secured
it
,
then
they
came
out
,
took
off
my
tire
(
it
was
a
runflat
-
but
runflats
do
n't
do
you
any
good
if
they
blow
out
)
,
and
brought
it
to
their
shop
to
change
the
tire
.

they
were
back
quickly
considering
how
far
outside
of
murfreesboro
we
were
and
had
us
on
our
way
by
6:30
that
evening
.

thanks
bud
for
all
of
your
help
and
taking
time
away
from
your
family
that
evening
.

it
's
without
a
doubt
,
the
best
service
experience
i
've
ever
had
and
just
to
be
clear
,
the
price
he
charged
me
was
the
same
as
my
tire
guy
in
nashville
's
price
for
putting
on
the
other
rear
tire
.

i
hope
i
can
return
the
favor
in
the
future
!

service
and
client
base
not
ok
.

i
have
stayed
in
this
hotel
many
times
,
and
while
it
typically
offers
a
decent
bang
for
the
buck
,
its
client
base
largely
consists
of
troubled
youngsteers
and
evictees
from
the
local
,
not
so
pleasant
hood
.

i
have
never
considered
this
a
real
problem
as
i
travel
without
kids
and
can
fend
for
myself
,
but
when
i
had
to
listen
to
a
(
non-violent
)
domestic
fight
that
lasted
from
1
am
to
5
am
during
my
last
stay
and
i
found
out
that
the
front
desk
was
unmanned
during
night
hours
,
my
choice
was
to
either
waste
tax
payers
money
by
calling
for
a
yet
another
police
dispatch
to
this
hotel
,
or
just
get
over
it
.

i
chose
the
later
,
but
approached
the
front
desk
about
the
hotel
policy
to
push
over
their
responsibilities
on
local
authorities
,
not
to
mention
the
good
night
s
sleep
i
paid
for
but
did
nt
get
.

i
was
told
management
would
call
me
back
but
still
waiting
for
that
call
.

i
will
probably
stay
here
again
because
it
s
cheap
and
i
ca
nt
afford
a
better
hotel
,
but
do
not
look
forward
to
it
and
would
definitely
not
recommend
this
hotel
for
families
or
single
female
travellers
.

was
there
this
past
weekend
and
the
guy
behind
the
counter
yelled
at
me
and
my
son
because
we
believed
he
left
the
grandma
slice
in
the
oven
a
little
too
long
and
the
cheese
got
all
dried
out
and
the
slice
tasted
more
like
a
cracker
.

he
preceded
to
grab
the
slice
off
the
countertop
and
throw
it
into
the
trash
while
yelling
at
me
saying
,
"
you
do
not
order
what
you
do
not
know
about
"
and
"
you
do
n't
know
how
pizza
is
made
"
.

it
was
very
upsetting
to
see
this
kind
of
behavior
especially
in
front
of
my
four
year
old
.

he
was
in
the
process
of
making
me
a
pie
and
when
i
got
home
,
the
pie
was
the
worst
i
have
ever
seen
.

cheese
was
falling
off
,
so
oily
and
greasy
.

i
think
he
did
it
on
purpose
because
of
my
simple
request
for
another
slice
of
grandma
that
was
n't
so
well
-
done
(
actually
,
burnt
)
.

i
will
never
go
back
to
this
place
and
i
am
reporting
them
to
the
better
business
bureau
for
such
horrible
customer
relations
and
basically
sabotaging
my
pizza
and
taking
my
$
25
.

this
story
is
100
%
true
.

that
little
man
who
thinks
he
invented
pizza
can
kiss

*ss

long
lines
,
silly
rules
,
rude
staff
,
ok
food

the
first
thing
you
notice
when
you
arrive
on
location
is
that
the
waiting
line
literally
goes
out
the
door
and
spills
into
the
parking
lot
.

a
restaurant
with
this
many
patrons
willing
to
stand
in
line
just
to
order
tacos
must
be
good
,
right
?

i
mean
,
that
's
the
way
it
works
at
amusement
parks
:
the
longest
lines
are
at
the
best
rides
.

well
,
this
may
be
an
exception
.

the
staff
taking
your
order
and
"
waiting
"
on
you
are
very
indifferent
and
have
no
sense
of
costumer
service
at
all
.

i
have
gotten
better
results
talking
to
comcast
customer
service
than
with
these
folks
.

and
do
n't
even
think
about
asking
to
speak
to
the
manager
because
this
guy
is
,
and
pardon
my
french
,
a
jerk
.

if
you
have
gotten
through
ordering
,
dealing
with
the
rude
staff
and
if
you
followed
the
dumb
rules
,
you
are
finally
presented
with
what
you
came
for
..
some
tacos
that
are
"
ok
,
"
but
definitely
not
worth
putting
up
with
all
the
hassle
.

save
yourself
the
trouble
and
skip
this
place
all
together
.

i
suggest
you
go
up
to
raging
taco
&
raging
burrito
a
couple
of
blocks
up
the
street
or
even
taco
mac
.

wish
this
was
in
saratoga
--

we
were
introduced
to
bistro
tallulah
by
traveler
-
professional
diner
who
happens
to
own
the
adelphi
hotel
and
travels
the
world
--
and
residing
in
paris
,
london
,
new
york
the
rest
of
the
year
.

she
knows
great
food
and
dining
experiences
.

she
was
dead
on
--
this
restaurant
was
wonderful
---
do
not
be
put
off
by
the
one
negative
review
on
this
page
.

i
can
tell
you
we
were
pleasantly
surprised
--
bt
has
taste
memory
and
each
time
back
the
food
was
consistently
delicious
--
same
dishes
--
were
consistent
.

our
friend
is
a
world
traveler
and
loves
unpretentious
dining
experiences
and
inspired
food
.

this
chef
knows
what
he
is
doing
.

treat
yourself
and
go
--
you
will
go
back
!

i
am
a
business
owner
in
downtown
saratoga
springs
and
wish
this
restaurant
was
in
our
town
!

the
affordable
rent
makes
it
possible
for
an
inspired
chef
to
serve
his
high
quality
fare
at
affordable
prices
!

unlike
saratoga
.

i
rrly
seek
the
cehf
out
to
introduce
myself
--
but
the
second
time
we
went
--
i
made
a
point
of
asking
our
wait
person
to
introduce
my
friend
and
myself
to
the
chef
to
tell
him
just
how
good
our
meals
were
.

can
not
wait
to
go
gain

i
think
that
the
re
pretty
good
.

first
of
all
,
if
you
call
for
an
appointment
they
wo
n't
tell
you
to
call
back
a
month
later
so
you
can
then
make
one
.

they
also
do
n't
tell
you
that
they
're
going
to
mail
you
an
"
application
"
to
be
admitted
to
be
a
patient
.

i
feel
that
the
way
some
doctor
s
offices
work
around
here
is
a
little
bit
absurd
so
i
'm
happy
that
these
guys
do
n't
do
those
two
things
in
particlular
.

usually
you
can
be
seen
the
same
week
or
maybe
the
following
week
.

the
doctor
did
tell
me
that
my
male
pattern
baldness
is
due
to
my
mother
s
father
because
the
gene
is
exclusively
passed
on
through
maternal
line
but
that
's
a
common
misconception
(
http://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-living/beauty-personal-care/hair-loss-10-08/hair-loss.htm
)
.

in
general
i
would
say
that
the
staff
is
attentive
and
nice
.

but
then
again
i
was
nice
to
them
so
that
could
have
been
why
.

anyhow
,
after
reading
some
of
the
other
reviews
it
seems
like
some
of
the
other
reviewers
are
expecting
mircles
.

if
you
want
miracles
you
'll
have
to
go
to
21st
st
.

it
's
a
pretty
typical
primary
care
office
but
for
the
area
it
's
very
good
.

they
do
n't
do
certain
things
that
are
really
annoying
about
other
offices
.

first
trip
to
canada

i
recently
traveled
to
canada
on
business
and
had
a
most
excellent
experience
.

i
work
for
a
large
retail
company
recently
expanding
our
operations
into
canada
and
had
to
travel
to
ensure
all
of
our
computer
network
equipment
was
installed
properly
and
on
time
.

this
can
tend
to
be
a
stressful
experience
in
itself
let
alone
adding
crossing
boarders
for
the
first
time
.

i
was
very
pleased
to
find
my
accommodations
and
the
hotel
staff
to
be
a
very
calming
and
comforting
part
of
my
trip
.

i
found
the
hotel
to
be
amazingly
clean
,
not
to
mention
very
well
adorned
with
many
pleasant
surprises
.

from
my
first
encounter
at
check
in
to
my
regrettable
check
out
i
found
the
staff
and
facility
to
exceed
my
expectation
.

i
completely
enjoyed
my
whole
check
in
experience
and
was
impressed
with
the
friendliness
and
professionalism
of
the
staff
as
well
as
the
accommodations
themselves
.

i
will
be
traveling
in
this
area
in
the
future
and
you
can
be
assured
that
this
experience
will
be
helpful
in
my
choice
of
hotels
and
novotel
will
be
my
first
selection
.

yes
the
parking
can
be
a
challenge
but
being
from
nj
i
am
no
stranger
to
tight
corners
.

please
pass
my
appreciation
to
the
staff
and
management
for
their
excellent
hospitality
and
good
spirits
as
it
helped
make
a
stressful
trip
enjoyable
.

update
:
i
had
to
add
to
my
review
.

i
was
just
in
last
night
and
had
a
chance
to
dine
in
their
new
dining
room
.

amazing
!

i
frequent
this
resturant
on
a
weekly
basis
but
usally
only
for
lunch
.

well
i
was
in
for
a
treat
when
i
was
greeted
by
the
friendly
girls
at
the
counter
who
asked
if
my
wife
and
i
would
like
to
sit
in
their
"
new
"
dining
room
.

right
away
they
told
us
that
it
was
the
same
great
food
with
the
same
prices
so
off
we
went
.

we
were
greeted
again
and
sat
promptly
.

after
looking
at
the
menu
and
seeing
the
new
menu
items
they
had
,
we
knew
we
were
in
for
a
treat
!

i
had
the
chicken
parmesan
dinner
and
my
wife
had
the
shrimp
scampi
dinner
.

amazing
!

the
portions
were
generous
enough
that
we
even
took
some
home
!

i
have
to
say
the
value
of
this
place
always
amazes
me
.

it
's
nice
to
see
that
even
in
the
economy
we
can
eat
a
place
that
has
upscale
service
,
amazing
atmosphere
,
and
incredible
food
,
but
not
break
the
bank
while
enjoying
it
!

bottom
line
is
that
when
it
's
a
small
privatly
owned
resturant
like
this
is
you
can
tell
that
the
owners
and
employees
take
pride
in
their
product
and
service
.

well
done
!

great
work
and
honest
establishment
!

i
typically
have
work
done
on
my
jeep
at
the
dealership
,
but
it
is
6
years
old
now
and
getting
charged
dealership
prices
just
did
n't
seem
cost
effective
anymore
.

i
had
tried
out
few
place
around
the
area
and
had
been
ripped
off
a
few
times
.

i
had
hear
great
things
about
phet
and
g&g
automotive
so
i
decided
to
give
him
a
try
.

the
service
was
excellent
and
personable
.

he
checked
out
what
i
needed
to
have
done
told
me
what
needed
be
fixed
before
he
did
any
work
and
did
great
repair
work
.

the
price
was
actually
lower
than
what
i
had
anticipated
and
used
to
compared
to
other
places
,
plus
he
showed
me
the
work
he
did
when
i
came
in
to
pick
up
the
car
.

also
,
a
week
after
the
work
,
phet
called
me
up
to
see
how
my
car
was
running
and
to
let
me
know
that
they
had
accidentally
overcharged
me
for
part
of
the
work
and
wanted
to
give
me
a
refund
for
that
amount
.

that
is
just
unheard
of
these
days
!

i
grew
up
in
a
small
town
where
you
knew
and
trusted
your
mechanic
and
was
really
cynical
about
city
auto
repair
shops
since
i
moved
here
,
but
phet
has
shown
that
there
really
are
honest
hard
working
mechanics
around
.

he
is
my
mechanic
going
forward
!

our
company
is
a
high
end
designer
handbag
and
fashion
accessories
company
,
thus
we
are
certainly
a
niche
market
.

we
had
been
evaluating
seo
providers
for
quite
some
time
and
finally
decided
to
take
the
plunge
with
stuart
,
and
ulistic
.

we
made
the
decision
for
a
couple
of
reasons
.

1
.
social
media
.

we
were
familiar
with
search
engine
optimization
strategies
,
but
new
nothing
about
social
media
-
we
just
heard
that
it
was
the
next
big
thing
.

2
.
we
really
liked
the
fact
that
stuart
sets
defined
objectives
and
we
meet
once
a
month
to
go
over
our
key
performance
indicators
.

how
has
it
gone
so
far
?

well
we
have
been
working
with
ulistic
for
1.5
months
,
and
have
100
people
following
our
site
on
facebook
,
and
our
web
site
,
www.designofashion.com
has
seen
a
3
fold
increase
in
traffic
,
which
is
significantly
beating
our
expectations
-
seo
is
a
process
that
takes
time
and
to
get
results
this
quickly
is
exceptional
.

we
are
absolutely
confident
that
stuart
's
ethical
and
focused
strategies
will
see
these
trends
continue
to
grow
,
and
our
business
will
reap
the
rewards
of
this
program
.

finally
,
it
must
be
said
that
stuart
is
a
fantastic
person
to
work
with
,
because
of
his
solid
strategies
and
equally
as
importantly
because
he
is
a
genuinely
good
person
and
a
great
communicator
.

excellent
service
and
quality

i
had
hom
-
excel
replace
most
of
the
windows
in
my
tampa
residence
three
years
ago
.

the
excellent
windows
have
performed
without
any
problems
,
but
that
's
not
why
i
'm
writing
my
review
.

three
weeks
ago
,
burglars
tried
to
gain
entry
into
the
rear
of
my
home
.

the
intruders
slit
the
screen
of
the
window
.

next
,
they
tried
to
force
the
window
with
a
pry
bar
and
then
to
break
the
window
with
a
hammer
.

the
window
did
n't
break
!

my
next
-
door
neighbor
heard
the
noise
and
turned
on
a
light
,
thankfully
scaring
the
two
miscreants
away
(
they
even
left
their
hammer
behind
!
)
.

i
called
home
-
excel
the
next
day
to
order
a
replacement
screen
for
the
window
,
and
was
happily
surprised
when
they
said
that
they
were
n't
even
going
to
charge
me
for
the
replacement
screen
...
that
it
would
be
covered
under
their
guarentee
.

lo
and
behold
,
they
replaced
the
screen
(
which
had
to
be
ordered
)
yesterday
and
did
n't
charge
me
a
dime
.

their
worker
even
cleaned
3
of
my
windows
and
changed
a
lightbulb
for
me
.

in
this
day
and
age
,
it
is
so
rare
to
find
a
company
with
such
nice
workers
and
such
far
ranging
guarantee
policies
.

i
rarely
write
reviews
such
as
this
one
,
but
they
certainly
deserve
anyone
's
business
!

friendly
staff
,
but
definitely
some
problems

may
,
2009
.

we
were
booked
at
the
sheraton
with
a
number
of
other
out
-
of
-
town
wedding
guests
.

got
put
into
the
wrong
room
the
first
night
,
and
were
quite
surprised
to
have
someone
with
the
same
room
key
trying
to
get
in
the
door
at
1:00
am
!

next
day
got
moved
into
another
room
,
on
the
same
floor
with
other
wedding
guests
.

there
were
3
adults
in
our
room
but
towels
for
only
2
,
no
linens
for
sofa
bed
.

in
the
second
room
it
took
3
tries
to
get
all
the
towels
and
linens
we
requested
.

a
package
and
some
wedding
cards
were
left
in
our
first
room
.

they
were
sent
to
our
second
room
and
had
been
opened
--
the
ribbon
-
wrapped
present
,
and
all
3
envelopes
.

security
in
the
hotel
seemed
to
be
excellent
,
but
we
were
never
given
an
explanation
as
to
why
someone
would
open
these
items
.

a
mid-afternoon
"
fire
drill
"
was
disruptive
,
putting
everyone
out
of
the
hotel
.

when
we
called
the
front
desk
about
an
extremely
boisterous
crowd
in
the
hall
outside
our
door
quite
late
at
night
,
it
seemed
to
take
the
hotel
staff
quite
a
while
to
quiet
them
down
.

the
staff
was
friendly
,
especially
the
front
desk
female
supervisor
,
and
seemed
to
want
to
help
,
but
too
many
unusual
things
happened
to
make
us
want
to
stay
there
again
.

be
careful
of
who
your
sales
guy
is

i
think
this
place
is
probably
really
great
especially
judging
by
the
reviews
on
here
.

my
experience
was
awful
though
.

it
all
had
to
do
with
the
sales
guy
which
was
a
young
22
year
old
who
had
admittedly
only
been
working
for
2
weeks
.

i
was
extremely
interested
in
the
car
and
very
likely
would
have
bought
it
,
but
the
sales
guy
i
dealt
with
ruined
the
deal
.

essentially
,
i
told
him
i
did
n't
trust
him
cause
he
was
a
car
salesman
,
but
he
got
so
incredibly
offended
at
that
statement
that
he
had
to
go
cry
to
another
salesman
and
compose
himself
before
coming
back
.

i
do
n't
know
if
the
kid
had
a
bad
day
or
what
,
but
i
had
to
sit
and
apologize
about
nothing
for
10
minutes
until
he
dropped
the
issue
.

after
that
,
i
just
tried
to
ignore
his
lack
of
professionalism
and
test
drive
the
car
.

i
played
dumb
and
asked
him
questions
that
i
already
knew
the
answers
to
and
he
responded
with
half
truths
and
a
few
falsehoods
.

for
instance
i
asked
who
owned
mazda
and
he
said
with
confidence
that
was
gm
,
which
is
n't
true
.

i
mean
,
i
do
n't
care
if
he
does
n't
know
,
but
if
he
pretends
to
know
and
tells
me
bs
to
my
face
,
there
's
no
way
i
'm
going
to
trust
him
when
matters
turn
to
the
price
of
the
car
and
financing
.

the
worst
chinese
i
've
ever
had

this
is
by
far
the
worst
chinese
food
i
have
ever
had
.

the
service
stunk
.

i
called
in
my
order
and
upon
arriving
to
pick
it
up
,
they
got
my
order
confused
with
someone
else
s
.

they
helped
about
three
other
people
before
they
offered
to
help
me
again
.

they
also
got
my
friend
s
order
mixed
up
and
wanted
to
charger
her
$
10
more
than
what
she
had
wanted
.

she
asked
for
the
dinner
combo
and
they
gave
her
two
dinner
plates
instead
.

we
were
standing
in
the
store
for
20
minutes
to
simply
pick
up
an
order
.

not
to
mention
that
the
wait
staff
was
about
as
pleasant
as
dealing
with
an
angry
bull
.

they
were
abrasive
and
rude
-
when
they
were
the
ones
who
messed
everything
up
.

we
had
to
throw
out
about
80
percent
of
our
meals
because
the
food
tasted
so
horrible
.

i
do
nt
know
how
it
is
possible
to
make
orange
chicken
,
sesame
chicken
and
kung
pao
chicken
as
well
as
cheese
puffs
taste
that
bad
but
china
delight
accomplished
that
.

the
only
thing
that
was
edible
was
the
steamed
rice
and
the
vegetable
lo
mein
was
barely
tolerable
.

i
will
never
go
here
again
.

lucky
panda
in
willis
is
a
billion
times
better
in
service
and
quality
of
the
meal
.

i
have
no
idea
how
china
delight
won
number
1
chinese
restaurant
in
montgomery
-
there
needs
to
be
a
recount
on
that
vote
.

terrible
service

one
of
the
worst
experiences
i
've
ever
had
with
a
auto
repair
shop
.

we
took
our
vehicle
in
for
a
repair
to
the
air
conditioning
.

approx
4
months
later
,
the
compressor
went
out
.

we
took
it
back
in
to
have
it
repaired
again
,
and
less
than
a
week
later
the
second
compressor
went
out
.

we
went
in
for
a
third
visit
and
they
fixed
it
again
,
but
this
time
when
we
picked
up
the
car
,
the
radio
and
clock
did
not
work
.

so
for
the
4th
time
in
5
months
and
the
third
time
in
2
weeks
,
we
brought
the
car
back
again
.

when
we
expressed
our
discontent
to
the
manager
(
that
's
right
,
the
manager
)
,
did
he
say
he
would
return
some
money
,
did
he
say
he
would
give
a
discount
on
our
next
visit
,
did
he
just
say
"
i
'm
sorry
"
.

nope
,
none
of
the
above
.

he
stood
there
and
told
us
how
he
was
n't
at
fault
.

it
was
the
fault
of
the
parts
supplier
,
and
can
we
imagine
how
he
felt
having
to
put
another
2
hours
of
work
in
the
car
.

and
what
did
we
expect
...
that
he
bench
test
every
part
.

at
no
time
during
the
conversation
did
the
words
,
"
i
'm
sorry
"
ever
come
out
of
his
mouth
.

i
,
nor
anyone
else
in
my
family
,
will
ever
go
to
sun
devil
auto
again
.

well
,
unless
of
course
the
third
compressor
he
put
in
the
car
goes
out
.

do
not
use
this
company
!

i
dropped
off
a
sheet
metal
piece
that
i
needed
copied
due
to
th
it
was
needing
to
be
replaced
.

i
asked
if
they
could
copy
the
piece
i
dropped
off
.

they
said
it
would
be
made
exactly
like
the
one
i
needed
to
replace
.

i
picked
it
up
when
it
was
finished
and
was
charge
30.00
.

when
i
got
to
the
job
and
tried
to
insert
the
new
piece
of
metal
it
would
not
fit
!!

i
took
the
original
piece
of
metal
and
rigged
it
to
make
due
since
i
had
to
complete
the
job
.

i
took
the
receipt
and
the
metal
that
did
not
fit
and
asked
pomper
for
my
money
back
.

the
girl
at
the
desk
was
sooo
rude
i
could
not
believe
it
!

she
told
me
she
could
not
use
the
piece
i
was
returning
and
the
company
would
only
put
it
in
the
trash
so
i
could
not
return
it
.

i
explained
i
did
not
get
what
i
paid
for
.

she
asked
me
to
bring
the
original
piece
back
and
i
told
her
i
had
to
use
it
on
the
job
.

she
told
me
that
was
to
bad
she
would
do
nothing
to
help
me
since
she
could
not
use
or
resell
the
piece
.

i
said
i
was
going
to
trash
it
also
and
could
i
at
least
have
a
credit
.

with
a
smirk
on
her
face
she
told
me
no
money
is
being
returned
and
that
is
the
way
it
was
.

do
not
use
this
company
.

there
are
to
many
people
that
need
our
business
to
have
to
put
up
with
this
unfair
treatment
!!!!!

i
would
never
recommend
this
gym
to
anyone
and
unfortunately
this
is
based
solely
on
the
owner
's
own
unprofessionalism
.

when
i
originally
joined
in
january
i
only
did
so
because
i
was
told
i
would
be
able
to
cancel
the
12
month
membership
if
i
was
to
move
away
.

i
signed
up
with
one
of
the
staff
who
was
very
pleasant
and
professional
.

actually
working
out
there
was
good
-
the
machines
are
nice
and
the
classes
are
fun
.

the
locker
room
is
certainly
lacking
-
i
would
never
shower
or
change
there
.

they
need
to
update
the
locker
rooms
asap
.

back
to
my
poor
rating
-
i
was
excepted
to
medical
school
and
went
in
to
cancel
my
membership
as
i
was
told
i
could
do
since
i
was
moving
away
.

the
owner
was
very
rude
,
accused
me
of
not
reading
my
contract
,
and
basically
told
me
to
shut
up
when
i
was
trying
to
ask
questions
to
further
understand
the
process
of
canceling
my
membership
.

i
was
able
to
cancel
it
but
only
after
paying
a
$
50
fee
(
which
the
staff
person
who
signed
me
up
stated
i
would
not
have
to
pay
if
i
had
proof
of
moving
)
and
being
spoken
to
in
a
very
belittling
manner
.

i
would
understand
if
i
was
being
treated
this
way
by
a
staff
member
but
the
club
's
actual
owner
?!

bad
for
business
.

i
was
appalled
.

i
will
never
recommend
this
gym
to
any
woman
.

the
equipment
and
classes
are
n't
good
enough
to
deal
with
the
rudeness
from
the
staff
!!!

there
are
better
places
on
the
cape

the
salon
experience
from
hell

i
feel
obligated
to
share
this
story
.

right
out
of
college
i
called
the
salon
and
explained
my
situation
.

just
graduated
,
just
moved
,
not
rich
,
and
starting
new
job
soon
.

i
never
got
a
price
quote
over
the
phone
and
they
take
your
cc
info
just
to
make
the
appointment
because
if
you
do
n't
show
up
,
they
'll
charge
you
.

i
had
this
ridiculous
celebrity
stylist
from
la
named
derrick
.

after
he
already
put
product
on
my
hair
he
said
"
i
should
warn
you
,
i
'm
expensive
.
"

what
was
i
supposed
to
do
,
say
i
ca
n't
afford
you
and
walk
out
with
crap
all
over
my
hair
.

i
wanted
to
be
very
blonde
and
instead
he
pulled
my
root
color
throughout
my
whole
hair
which
is
a
gross
mousey
brown
.

the
other
stylists
around
me
kept
pressuring
me
saying
he
's
so
wonderful
,
you
're
going
to
love
your
hair
.

$
400
later
my
jaw
dropped
when
the
receptionist
told
me
the
total
.

derrick
did
a
terrible
job
,
was
a
complete
jerk
the
entire
time
,
and
i
had
no
warning
as
to
the
price
.

i
cried
the
entire
way
home
.

he
then
"
fixed
"
it
for
free
but
it
still
looked
like
crap
.

i
will
never
go
back
.

it
was
the
salon
experience
from
absolutely
hell
.

he
also
told
me
that
he
worked
on
the
cast
of
will
and
grace
and
that
they
were
all
jerks
.

that
's
my
favorite
show
of
all
time
.

i
'm
pretty
sure
for
the
cast
that
it
was
the
other
way
around
.

maybe
he
did
n't
do
a
good
job
and
they
told
him
so
.

absolute
nightmare
!

stay
away
!

very
unhappy
...

working
with
rod
jacobsen
was
my
first
experience
working
with
a
cpa
,
so
i
did
not
know
what
to
expect
.

that
said
-
he
seemed
to
be
doing
well
enough
.

however
,
then
i
asked
to
amend
my
return
to
apply
a
credit
i
had
just
become
eligible
for
.

i
expected
to
pay
for
this
service
,
but
imagine
my
surprise
when
i
received
a
bill
for
more
than
what
i
paid
to
have
the
original
return
prepared
.

asked
why
,
rod
simply
told
me
that
he
had
to
research
how
to
do
the
amendment
(
it
was
an
amended
to
show
that
i
had
purchased
a
home
-
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
,
one
would
think
)
and
that
took
time
to
figure
out
.

well
,
that
was
strike
one
.

i
was
n't
going
to
use
them
again
,
but
i
was
going
to
leave
it
at
that
.

however
,
now
that
i
have
come
to
realize
that
i
am
going
to
owe
the
irs
$
6,000
+
despite
doing
exactly
what
rod
told
me
to
do
,
i
feel
i
have
to
voice
my
opinion
.

last
year
,
after
all
was
said
and
done
,
i
asked
rod
whether
my
payment
structure
would
leave
me
with
no
/
little
tax
liability
at
the
end
of
the
year
.

he
said
yes
.

well
,
again
,
i
am
now
faced
with
a
tax
bill
of
$
6,000
+
,
all
due
on
april
15
,
2010
and
all
that
rod
has
to
say
to
the
matter
is
'
well
,
you
wo
n't
have
to
pay
a
penalty
.
'

i
may
not
have
to
pay
a
penalty
,
yet
,
but
this
is
not
what
i
had
in
mind
when
hired
these
guys
.

in
the
words
of
my
new
accountant
,
they
let
me
down
!

bit
sketchy
,
sporadic
delivery
times

i
bought
about
half
of
the
furniture
i
own
from
this
place
.

why
?

because
they
cut
me
good
deals
if
i
paid
in
cash
.

sketchy
,
right
?

well
they
came
through
and
delivered
almost
all
of
my
items
within
a
few
days
.

(
they
even
got
me
a
couch
pretty
quickly
.
)

the
guy
who
was
cutting
me
the
deals
and
getting
me
the
furniture
quickly
,
ahmed
,
was
nice
and
mostly
professional
,
except
the
semi-sketchiness
.

then
one
day
,
ahmed
left
the
country
,
not
to
return
for
months
,
without
informing
me
.

he
also
neglected
to
tell
the
other
person
working
at
the
store
about
a
dining
room
table
that
i
had
ordered
and
that
was
supposed
to
be
coming
in
.

the
other
person
working
at
the
store
did
n't
know
that
i
still
had
this
table
coming
.

i
had
paid
in
cash
,
and
he
said
he
had
no
receipt
/
record
of
my
purchase
.

i
came
back
with
the
receipt
ahmed
had
provided
upon
my
purchase
,
and
the
guy
took
forever
to
copy
it
but
said
that
he
would
take
care
of
the
situation
.

i
waited
.

and
waited
.

he
never
once
contacted
us
.

i
've
had
to
pester
this
new
guy
several
times
to
ask
when
my
table
will
arrive
.

he
kept
saying
different
arrival
/
delivery
dates
and
did
n't
seem
terribly
apologetic
.

it
has
been
3
weeks
and
i
still
do
n't
have
my
table
(
which
was
not
cheap
,
i
might
add
)
.

point
is
:
you
might
be
able
to
get
a
good
deal
on
some
nice
furniture
--
which
i
did
--
but
they
're
not
very
communicative
and
god
forbid
something
goes
wrong
,
you
'll
have
to
fight
to
get
it
resolved
.

poor
service

run
do
n't
walk
.

my
experience
with
home
delivery
service
has
been
one
of
disappointment
and
anger
.

if
i
could
give
them
a
lower
rating
than
poor
i
would
.

on
august
21st
,
2009
i
ordered
furniture
from
hickory
furniture
mart
and
contracted
for
hds
to
deliver
it
.

after
seventeen
days
the
delivery
van
showed
up
at
my
home
minus
two
pieces
.

i
was
later
told
they
had
been
left
at
the
warehouse
and
some
future
date
they
would
be
delivered
.

no
one
will
give
me
a
date
.

i
spent
$
2300
on
the
bedroom
suite
,
which
was
complete
and
excellent
condition
on
the
showroom
floor
.

upon
delivery
it
was
clear
the
entire
set
was
damaged
:
a
piece
of
wood
was
broke
on
the
headboard
;
the
chest
of
drawers
was
missing
all
four
pieces
necessary
to
attach
the
legs
;
the
dresser
back
legs
were
pushed
in
causing
the
dresser
to
lean
into
the
wall
;
and
a
nighstand
was
missing
a
drawer
.

how
do
you
lose
a
drawer
.

after
complaining
on
september
10th
to
national
home
furnishings
,
boyles
,
the
hickory
furniture
mart
and
home
delivery
service
the
latter
finally
called
me
back
and
said
they
would
be
up
to
pick
the
dresser
and
chest
of
drawers
at
some
future
point
and
at
some
later
point
it
would
be
professional
repaired
and
at
some
later
point
it
would
be
returned
.

the
customer
service
at
home
delivery
service
was
terrible
let
alone
their
promise
to
proper
set
up
furniture
.

so
i
am
in
limbo
regarding
a
bedroom
suite
.

i
hope
the
owners
and
employees
of
this
store
have
broken
bedroom
suites
in
their
homes
and
furniture
sitting
in
someone
's
warehouse
.

maybe
then
they
will
begin
to
understand
poor
customer
service
and
terrible
sit
up
service
.

excellent
driving
school

i
was
involved
in
a
car
accident
20
years
ago
and
since
then
i
've
been
a
nervous
wreck
and
have
n't
been
behind
the
wheel
.

unfortunately
,
a
family
emergency
required
me
to
conquer
this
fear
.

a
very
good
friend
of
mine
highly
recommended
the
professional
driving
school
and
i
was
told
to
specifically
ask
for
gerry
.

she
highly
recommended
him
and
described
him
as
the
"
saintly
instructor
and
simply
the
best
instructor
there
is
....
very
calm
,
pleasant
and
very
detailed
in
giving
instructions
"
.

i
called
the
school
most
probably
10
times
before
i
finally
enrolled
in
a
20
hour
package
.

i
had
to
cancel
my
initial
lesson
4
times
and
on
the
5th
attempt
the
management
was
quick
enough
to
associate
my
cancellations
with
my
fear
and
finally
encouraged
me
into
taking
my
initial
lesson
.

five
minutes
before
my
initial
lesson
,
i
got
a
call
from
gerry
advising
me
of
his
arrival
and
to
come
down
as
soon
as
i
was
ready
.

my
heart
pounded
as
i
walked
down
and
pounded
even
faster
upon
seeing
gerry
in
an
suv
-
lexus
!

i
thought
of
canceling
the
lesson
once
again
because
i
did
n't
feel
comfortable
driving
an
suv
.

gerry
pleasantly
said
"
since
i
am
already
here
why
do
n't
we
give
it
shot
.

i
trust
you
and
believe
that
you
'll
be
able
to
handle
this
and
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
reciprocate
!

trust
me
and
most
especially
trust
and
believe
in
yourself
.

do
n't
worry
,
i
'll
take
care
of
you
!
"

.......
the
rest
was
history
!

here
i
am
now
driving
confidently
on
my
own
.

gerry
,
i
ca
n't
thank
you
enough
for
helping
me
cope
with
my
fear
.

to
my
friend
,
thank
you
for
your
recommendation
...
you
were
true
to
your
words
in
saying
gerry
is
a
"
saintly
instructor
...
absolutely
simple
the
best
instructor
and
best
driving
school
there
is
!

review
on
house
of
joy
chinese
restaurant

my
family
and
i
moved
to
san
antonio
a
year
ago
and
have
tried
almost
all
of
the
chinese
restaurants
because
we
love
chinese
food
.

well
it
took
us
a
while
to
find
one
that
we
liked
.

but
we
do
n't
just
like
house
of
joy
we
love
it
.

everything
we
have
gotten
there
has
been
more
authentic
and
better
tasting
than
any
other
chinese
restaurant
in
the
san
antonio
area
we
have
been
to
--
and
trust
me
we
have
been
to
a
lot
of
them
.

we
just
happen
to
stumble
across
this
little
restaurant
one
day
when
we
had
to
visit
the
bexar
county
tax
office
off
of
bandera
road
.

we
stopped
in
and
got
some
take
out
and
can
not
stop
going
back
.

they
have
the
best
egg
drop
soup
i
have
ever
tasted
.

we
also
love
their
egg
rolls
and
spring
rolls
.

and
every
entree
we
have
ordered
is
perfect
.

everything
is
always
cooked
fresh
and
tastes
fresh
.

their
prices
are
extremely
reasonable
for
the
amount
of
food
you
receive
.

the
staff
is
also
just
so
pleasant
to
deal
with
.

they
are
also
quick
at
getting
your
order
out
to
you
.

you
do
n't
have
to
sit
and
wait
around
forever
like
most
places
!!

so
anyone
looking
for
an
excellent
night
out
for
chinese
or
maybe
just
lunch
should
stop
in
and
try
it
because
i
promise
you
2
things
---
you
wo
n't
regret
it
!!

and
you
will
go
back
for
more
!!!

karla
ferguson
-
granger

ps
i
have
noticed
on
here
that
someone
left
a
comment
that
"
all
of
the
nice
comments
must
come
from
co
workers
or
friends
"
and
i
will
tell
you
that
i
do
n't
know
these
people
except
from
eating
at
their
restaurant
.

we
are
from
virginia
and
just
moved
here
a
year
ago
.

so
that
comment
is
completely
false
.

because
we
think
it
's
the
best
!!!

and
we
do
n't
know
them
except
for
eating
there
.

dr.
strzalka
at
flagship
cvts
is
not
a
good
doctor

i
am
not
sure
about
the
quality
of
the
other
doctors
there
,
but
i
do
know
from
personal
experience
that
dr.
christopher
t.
strzalka
is
not
a
man
of
his
word
,
and
is
also
very
cruel
and
uncaring
!!

he
was
going
to
operate
and
replace
my
bicuspid
aortic
valve
due
to
critical
aortic
stenosis
.

i
had
a
surgery
date
of
july
17
,
2008
.

then
he
renigged
when
he
read
my
health
care
proxy
,
even
though
i
agreed
to
be
on
the
ventilator
for
2
months
following
surgery
(
as
he
had
twice
stated
i
must
agree
to
)
.

he
later
said
that
by
2
months
he
"
meant
at
least
two
months
"
.

two
months
and
at
least
two
months
are
totally
different
things
.

he
did
not
even
give
me
the
chance
to
say
i
would
stay
on
the
ventilator
longer
,
which
i
would
have
.

a
health
care
proxy
is
not
written
in
stone
and
can
be
changed
.

he
also
never
even
said
he
was
sorry
.

just
said
i
was
inoperable
and
walked
out
of
the
hospital
room
.

so
,
therefore
,
now
he
says
i
am
inoperable
(
even
though
i
am
not
100
%
inoperable
)
,
and
he
is
letting
me
die
.

i
am
just
middle
aged
and
do
not
want
to
die
,
but
thanks
to
this
doctor
i
have
no
other
alternatives
.

i
,
along
with
my
friends
,
consider
this
doctor
to
be
the
cause
of
my
death
as
he
is
not
even
trying
to
save
my
life
by
operating
.

even
my
pa
i
went
to
the
other
day
said
"
it
must
by
comforting
to
have
gone
to
a
heart
surgeon
like
him
who
will
do
nothing
for
you
"
.

he
said
it
sarcastically
.

if
you
want
a
doctor
who
will
lie
to
you
and
say
he
will
operate
and
then
change
his
mind
,
and
not
know
what
he
is
talking
about
when
he
recommends
procedures
at
other
hospitals
and
says
they
are
what
you
need
,
when
they
will
not
work
for
you
,
go
to
this
doctor
...
he
is
the
one
for
you
.

what
you
can
learn
from
the
below
'
bad
experience
'
.

i
would
suggest
not
avoiding
second
home
based
on
the
'
bad
experience
'
review
.

i
'd
probably
be
more
inclined
to
board
my
two
dogs
here
,
seeing
that
they
do
n't
just
take
every
dog
coming
in
.

i
've
toured
this
place
and
was
impressed
by
how
clean
the
place
was
,
and
all
the
options
for
the
dogs
.

it
's
unfortunate
that
bmil
believed
that
his
'
perfect
'
dog
was
not
given
the
right
opportunity
to
prove
himself
.

but
i
've
done
hundreds
of
dog
introductions
myself
(
another
place
,
i
do
n't
work
here
)
,
and
owners
can
have
unrealistic
expectations
and
views
of
what
they
see
when
their
dogs
meet
other
dogs
.

workers
who
do
these
introductions
look
at
the
interaction
objectively
;
and
it
's
good
to
see
they
are
able
and
willing
to
say
no
if
they
feel
there
would
be
a
problem
.

it
sounds
(
according
to
your
own
statement
)
that
they
had
a
roomful
of
dogs
,
so
they
must
be
doing
something
right
-
and
are
keeping
those
dogs
safe
from
potential
problems
.

you
say
you
work
a
lot
,
and
that
you
have
a
young
dog
;
so
i
have
little
doubt
that
your
dog
is
just
filled
with
energy
to
burn
;
and
it
is
good
of
you
to
look
for
a
place
to
take
him
.

but
not
at
a
risk
to
other
people
's
pets
.

you
were
clearly
given
another
alternative
by
second
home
,
to
board
him
-
which
might
have
given
your
dog
a
chance
to
come
and
go
from
second
home
a
couple
times
,
getting
used
to
the
place
and
maybe
facilitating
another
attempt
to
get
into
daycare
later
.

no
business
is
going
to
push
customers
away
without
good
reason
;
so
is
n't
it
reasonable
to
think
they
might
know
what
they
're
doing
?

my
dogs
are
far
from
perfect
,
and
one
of
them
i
believe
would
be
a
little
much
for
daycare
here
herself
(
at
least
initially
)
.

be
a
little
more
reasonable
with
your
expectations
of
a
place
like
this
;
and
maybe
do
n't
jump
to
personal
attacks
suggesting
that
they
do
n't
want
to
work
hard
,
just
because
you
bruised
your
own
ego
.

dumbest
f'ers
ever

i
called
dominos
tonight
,
it
rang
forever
,
i
get

well
,
she
says
,
is
that
on
17th
street
.

yes
,
i
say
.

17th
,
like
over
by
16th
and
15th
yes
,
i
say
,
one
mile
west
of
you
.

you
're
at
7th
.

i
am
just
south
of
walnut
.

she
says
,
is
that
17th
like
over
past
broad
.

yes
,
i
am
west
of
broad
.

broad
,
i
say
,
is
14th
street
and
i
am
3
blocks
west
of
broad
and
one
south
of
walnut
.

hmmm
,
she
says
,
then
why
are
you
calling
here
,
we
do
n't
go
past
broad
?

anyway
,
after
much
yelling
and
cussing
i
hung
up
,
grabbed
a
cab
,
and
went
to
geno
's
.

quick
to
take
money
but
not
quick
to
fix
a
problem
!

b&b
came
out
very
quickly
to
give
us
our
quote
back
in
june
.

they
were
very
polite
,
eager
to
answer
any
questions
and
willing
to
wait
for
us
to
return
from
vacation
to
begin
installing
our
fence
.

our
fence
was
installed
quickly
in
august
and
they
had
their
money
and
left
saying
"
workmanship
is
guaranteed
for
a
year
!
"
.

within
a
week
we
noticed
one
of
the
boards
on
our
gate
splitting
where
a
nail
had
gone
in
.

we
called
our
representative
who
assured
me
he
would
call
the
office
and
have
it
taken
care
of
.

we
heard
nothing
.

we
then
called
the
office
and
the
man
we
spoke
to
said
he
'd
send
someone
out
to
look
at
it
but
could
n't
promise
when
-
two
weeks
came
and
went
and
we
heard
nothing
.

i
just
called
again
and
was
told
that
workmanship
,
not
wood
,
is
guaranteed
for
a
year
-
well
in
my
opinion
-
the
wood
split
due
to
a
nail
which
is
part
of
workmanship
!

she
even
went
so
far
as
to
say
"
you
r
calling
about
one
board
?
"

well
-
when
you
pay
over
$
1000
for
something
you
want
it
to
hold
up
and
look
good
!!!

yes
!

i
was
calling
about
one
board
!!

i
'm
very
frustrated
at
this
point
-
it
would
take
all
of
10
min
for
them
to
come
by
and
replace
the
one
board
that
is
cracked
(
the
crack
is
deep
enough
to
stick
a
penny
in
it
and
it
goes
clear
through
)
yet
they
do
not
want
to
take
the
time
to
bother
with
what
once
was
a
happy
customer
and
has
now
become
a
dissatisfied
customer
.

so
i
figure
if
they
do
n't
want
to
take
the
time
to
fix
the
fence
that
they
installed
then
i
'll
take
the
time
to
let
everyone
i
can
know
about
how
they
treat
customers
once
they
have
your
money
!!!

stay
away
!!!

you
get
what
you
pay
for
!!!

they
came
in
under
a
lot
of
other
quotes
and
now
i
know
why
!!!

when
the
fence
was
first
installed
i
would
have
given
them
five
stars
,
now
for
their
poor
customer
follow
-
up
and
unwillingness
to
fix
the
fence
they
have
dropped
to
a
one
-
star
in
my
opinion
!

lots
of
rules
,
phantom
innkeeper
,
last
minute
price
was
worth
it
.

i
called
the
"
207
"
number
and
listened
to
the
same
recording
loop
3
times
before
i
gave
up
.

i
then
called
the
800
number
(
which
was
answered
)
and
inquired
about
last
minute
rates
.

they
had
a
room
with
a
$
99
rate
,
which
i
booked
.

the
room
was
supposed
to
be
on
the
2nd
floor
,
but
they
put
us
on
the
3rd
.

the
email
confirmation
(
which
i
read
in
the
car
)
warned
about
large
suitcases
,
declaring
that
we
are
innkeepers
,
not
longshoreman
.

in
other
words
,
they
do
not
help
with
suitcases
,
but
they
promise
totes
to
help
.

however
upon
our
arrival
no
one
there
(
the
inn
was
open
)
.

so
no
totes
.

finally
a
chambermaid
stuck
her
head
around
the
corner
from
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
told
us
sternly
that
we
could
not
be
accommodated
until
3
m
,
no
exceptions
.

then
she
was
gone
.

we
returned
after
3
pm
,
found
no
one
there
,
and
a
note
from
the
innkeeper
with
directions
to
our
room
.

i
would
n't

quit
with
the
overstatements
!

the
worst
thing
that
can
happen
for
any
restaurant
like
zahav
is
to
have
too
many
people
write
hyperbolic
reviews
making
claims
that
"
everyone
"
is
going
to
"
love
"
the
food
,
decor
and
service
.

the
truth
is
,
in
my
and
my
dining
partners
'
experience
,
this
is
a
fine
little
restaurant
with
some
unique
food
.

it
's
an
entirely
up
and
down
experience
,
however
.

now
,
the
best
of
that
unique
food
comes
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
meal
.

the
salatim
salads
are
the
smallest
plates
i
've
ever
seen
placed
in
front
of
me
(
you
would
most
likely
think
they
were
condiments
if
it
were
n't
explained
to
you
)
.

though
they
are
mostly
excellent
,
you
generally
do
n't
get
enough
forkfuls
to
know
if
you
really
love
them
.

that
being
said
,
the
laffa
and
hummus
are
out
of
this
world
.

then
again
,
for
the
three
of
us
who
dined
together
,
two
pieces
of
flatbread
left
us
fighting
for
more
,
and
licking
the
hummus
from
our
fingers
(
and
yes
,
those
two
pieces
of
flatbread
did
represent
a
three
-
person
order
)
.

dinner
was
also
an
up
-
and
-
down
experience
.

the
vegetarian
dishes
and
lighter
fare
were
almost
always
spot
-
on
,
while
the
lamb
was
often
dry
and
/
or
overcooked
.

the
duck
was
a
65
%
glob
of
chewy
fat
with
no
resemblance
to
the
juicy
,
crispy
delicacy
it
usually
represents
at
other
establishments
.

dessert
was
...
hmmm
,
that
's
interesting
,
i
do
n't
even
remember
dessert
.

i
guess
that
tells
you
a
lot
.

oh
,
yes
,
the
chocolate
semifreddo
was
quite
good
.

the
warm
chocolate
cake
was
very
tasty
,
but
served
at
room
temperature
,
not
warm
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
.

and
my
--
no
,
i
still
do
n't
remember
what
i
had
.

service
was
average
,
but
nothing
special
,
and
restaurants
that
are
supposed
to
be
excellent
should
do
a
better
job
of
training
their
waitstaff
to
be
communicative
and
friendly
,
not
merely
capable
.

perhaps
had
we
not
gone
into
this
restaurant
believing
zahav
was
going
to
be
golden
as
its
name
suggests
(
and
as
the
many
golden
reviews
seem
to
attest
)
,
we
would
have
enjoyed
a
decent
little
expensive
experience
.

but
one
should
not
go
here
expecting
something
fantastic
,
unless
perhaps
you
've
never
had
middle
-
eastern
food
before
,
or
succulent
duck
,
tasty
lamb
,
decent
portion
sizes
or
actually
warm
chocolate
desserts
.

ps
)
when
we
called
for
a
reservation
,
we
were
told
that
5:00
and
9:30
were
their
only
openings
.

when
we
arrived
at
5
,
and
left
circa
7
,
there
were
the
same
4
or
5
empty
tables
surrounding
us
.

did
they
think
we
were
going
to
feel
lucky
to
get
any
reservation
at
all
,
and
therefore
be
more
pleased
with
our
dining
experience
?

must
read
-
do
not
waste
your
time
in
this
store
.

at
my
appointment
the
girl
helping
me
was
unable
to
adequately
lace
up
some
of
the
dresses
.

they
felt
like
they
were
going
to
fall
off
of
me
and
it
was
very
difficult
to
see
what
i
would
actually
look
like
were
i
to
purchase
some
of
these
dresses
.

i
thought
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
see
how
a
few
that
i
liked
would
look
like
on
a
model
(
by
looking
the
dress
up
online
)
.

so
,
as
i
was
leaving
i
asked
for
the
designer
/
dress
name
or
style
number
associated
with
my
top
picks
.

they
said
they
were
"
unable
to
tell
me
until
they
ordered
my
dress
"
.

hmmm
...
a
person
can
not
call
a
company
,
if
you
have
no
idea
its
name
(
since
the
designer
is
unknown
...
supposedly
)
,
and
order
a
gown
without
a
dress
name
or
style
number
.

do
other
brides
fall
for
this
???

they
either
:
a
)
do
n't
want
to
give
it
to
me
because
they
do
n't
want
me
purchasing
the
dress
elsewhere
or
b
)
are
recreating
the
dresses
themselves
(
ie
stealing
other
designers
'
dress
designs
and
"
filling
the
orders
"
by
their
own
seamstresses
)
.

i
'm
no
detective
but
...
uhh
...
seriously
?!?

whatever
type
of
operation
they
are
running
,
i
'm
not
interested
and
if
you
're
smart
,
you
wo
n't
be
either
.

what
a
waste
of
time
.

aside
from
that
little
*
mystery
*
,
one
of
the
sales
ladies
was
quite
comfortable
telling
me
how
wrong
i
was
about
how
another
dress
that
i
loved
compared
to
one
of
her
dresses
that
i
was
trying
on
.

somehow
,
since
she
supposedly
does
n't
know
any
names
of
designers
/
dresses
,
after
i
told
her
the
designer
and
dress
name
of
the
one
i
was
comparing
,
she
knew
"
exactly
which
dress
"
i
was
referring
to
and
disagreed
with
my
observation
;
she
said
that
the
bodice
did
come
as
low
as
the
one
i
had
on
.

my
point
:
even
if
i
was
wrong
,
do
n't
sit
there
and
argue
with
the
customer
.

say
something
like
,
"
huh
.

i
did
n't
think
so
but
you
could
be
right
.
"

unless
you
want
to
take
the
"
tell
the
customer
how
wrong
she
is
and
try
and
force
her
into
a
dress
she
's
obviously
not
loving
"
approach
which
will
likely
get
you
...
uh
...
nowhere
.

seriously
:
do
not
waste
your
time
.

other
shops
around
this
city
have
much
nicer
and
more
transparent
owners
.

not
owners
that
seem
like
they
have
something
to
hide
and
know
nothing
about
common
courtesy
and
customer
service
.

i
felt
very
much
like
wedding
gallery
was
being
dishonest
and
i
would
n't
trust
them
to
lace
me
up
in
another
gown
let
alone
trust
them
with
the
gown
i
will
wear
on
the
most
important
day
of
my
life
.

awful
service
!

after
happily
visiting
sear's
automotives
in
the
past
,
i
was
shocked
at
the
horrible
service
received
at
their
greensboro
location
.

i
brought
my
car
in
on
a
sunday
to
replace
a
shredded
tire
.

i
waited
about
20
minutes
in
the
store
part
before
anyone
was
able
to
assist
me
and
was
then
told
to
pull
my
car
into
the
shop
(
that
is
apparently
what
you
are
supposed
to
do
,
but
the
big
signs
pointing
you
that
way
are
for
some
reason
kept
inside
the
garage
,
so
you
do
n't
see
them
drving
up
,
and
they
purposely
block
the
front
pull
-
up
that
all
other
sear's
use
)
.

once
inside
,
i
had
to
stand
around
for
at
least
10
more
minutes
before
--
finally
--
a
technician
got
to
me
.

once
i
returned
to
pick
up
my
car
,
you
can
believe
i
spent
quite
a
bit
more
time
standing
around
waiting
.

i
had
wanted
to
split
the
total
between
a
credit
card
and
check
card
since
i
was
being
reimbursed
for
the
tire
but
was
told
this
was
n't
possible
.

once
i
actually
got
back
in
my
car
,
it
was
dirty
and
had
grease
all
over
the
steering
wheel
.

ok
,
one
bad
experience
...
fine
.

the
following
friday
,
i
returned
with
my
car
to
go
ahead
and
replace
the
other
3
tires
,
which
were
worn
.

i
would
not
have
gone
back
,
but
i
could
n't
find
the
particular
tire
they
'd
used
in
stock
anywhere
else
.

once
again
,
i
waited
for
quite
a
bit
before
being
attended
to
.

i
got
the
order
completed
,
and
then
questioned
the
technician
since
it
came
out
about
$
40
less
than
i
expected
.

he
said
it
was
the
same
tire
,
and
verified
this
,
after
checking
both
the
actual
tire
on
my
car
and
my
service
papers
from
earlier
in
the
week
.

however
,
when
he
printed
out
the
service
quote
,
i
could
see
that
it
was
not
the
correct
tire
,
and
was
not
even
an
appropriate
tire
for
my
car
model
.

so
i
pointed
this
out
to
him
,
at
which
point
he
said
they
only
had
one
of
the
correct
tires
in
stock
.

ok
--
fine
.

so
i
got
just
my
other
rear
tire
replaced
.

they
promised
it
'd
be
done
within
an
hour
,
so
i
waited
in
the
lobby
.

over
two
hours
later
(
and
ten
minutes
before
they
closed
)
my
car
was
finally
finished
.

a
few
minutes
after
i
left
,
i
was
called
and
informed
that
"
i
"
left
my
wheel
lock
(
which
they
should
have
left
in
the
car
)
.

of
course
,
they
would
be
closing
in
5
minutes
,
so
i
would
have
to
hurry
up
or
get
it
the
next
day
.

of
course
i
could
n't
make
it
back
in
time
(
and
they
apparently
could
not
stay
5
extra
minutes
to
wait
for
me
)
.

the
next
day
,
no
one
could
find
my
wheel
lock
and
that
particular
technician
was
not
in
.

of
course
,
they
could
n't
call
him
either
to
ask
about
it
because
apparently
they
do
n't
keep
their
employees
'
phone
numbers
(
riiight
)
,
so
i
would
have
to
return
on
monday
(
driving
for
3
days
now
with
no
wheel
lock
should
i
get
a
flat
)
.

on
monday
i
called
and
again
it
was
a
big
to
-
do
to
find
anyone
who
knew
anything
about
it
.

supposedly
they
will
be
holding
it
for
me
this
evening
,
but
i
'm
sure
that
will
also
be
a
huge
ordeal
.

the
employees
at
this
sear's
are
completely
apathetic
and
there
did
n't
seem
to
be
any
sort
of
management
that
i
could
see
.

i
will
never
return
there
again
(
and
now
have
some
serious
doubts
about
the
quality
of
work
they
actually
performed
on
my
car
)
.
