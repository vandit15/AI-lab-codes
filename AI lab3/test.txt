any
thoughts
?

no
hurry
,
i
was
just
wondering
.

thanks

kim
.

attached
is
the
tw
top
ten
shippers
by
revenues
for
the
year
2001
to
be
reported
in
the
browncover
report
.

note
:

total
transportation
invoiced
for
2001
was
$
180.9
m
.

the
amount
of
transportation
revenues
recorded
in
the
general
ledger
is
$
165.9
m
.

this
difference
is
mainly
due
to
the
following
:

$
10.0
m
-
negotiated
rates
reserve
(
reliant
,
sempra
,
richardson
,
astr
,
and
bp
energy
)
-
$
collected

$
2.7
m
-
socal
rate
issue
-
$
not
collected

$
1.8
m
-
additional
month
of
pge
revenues
due
to
prepayment
invoicing
beginning
in
2001
-
$
collected

revenues
for
these
customers
were
adjusted
according
.

also
,
revenues
for
the
shippers
acquiring
released
volumes
from
pge
at
rates
above
tw
's
tariff
rates
were
adjusted
accordingly
.

please

there
are
questions

kim
,

here
is
the
job
description
and
the
operational
accountabilities
for
the
position
i
mentioned
to
you
last
sunday
.

as
you
can
see
it
will
take
someone
with
some
very
good
skills
in
organizing
and
interpersonal
relationships
.

it
will
also
require
someone
who
is
fairly
mature
in
their
own
spiritual
journey
.

if
you
know
someone
who
might
fit
the
bill
ask
them
to
contact
me
and
/
or
send
me
their
resume
.

see
you
sunday
.

mansoor
,

let
's
discuss
.

kim
.

kim

the
in
-
service
date
of
may
1
,
will
be
very
difficult
to
attain
.

since
the
bankruptcy
filing
,
vendors
have
been
very
reluctant
to
ship
material
prior
to
it
being
prepaid
(
daniels
,
fisher
,
rosemont
,
other
)
.

these
are
the
vendors
of
instrumentation
required
for
the
interconnect
.

questar
may
be
able
to
purchase
material
,
but
some
of
the
items
can
have
up
to
a
60
day
delivery
.

(
from
time
pa
approved
and
funded
to
in
-
service
will
be
75
days
at
most
.

we
have
worked
with
daniels
on
a
chromatograph
on
another
project
and
prepayment
has
taken
45
days
alone
.

daniels
is
not
set
up
for
prepayments
as
they
bill
off
an
invoice
and
the
main
office
and
accounting
had
to
create
an
invoice
for
a
chromatograph
that
had
not
been
delivered
.

not
the
usual
mode
of
operations
.

the
i/c
design
is
for
a
ultrasonic
meter
and
this
is
dependent
on
their
testing
schedule
(
canada
or
kansas
are
the
only
two
places
to
test
to
100
%
of
design
)
.

will
confirm
testing
schedule
and
delivery
dates
with
ultrasonic
asap
.

we
will
try
to
complete
the
i/c
with
the
earliest
in
-
service
date
possible
,
but
with
conditions
as
they
are
,
a
realistic
date
would
be
june
15
,
2002
.

if
you
have
questions
or
issues
,
please
let
me
know
.

thanks

earl
,

we
are
looking
at
putting
the
metering
facilities
on
their
row
(
also
,
i
think
we
will
have
to
purchase
about
50
ft
of
row
from
elpaso
to
get
to
questar
's
property
)
.

as
you
look
at
this
,
if
for
some
reason
we
can
not
obtain
elpaso
row
,
we
will
have
to
look
at
plan
b
which
would
be
to
put
the
metering
on
our
row
.

our
in
-
service
date
is
may
1
.

if
you
think
that
may
1
may
be
difficult
due
to
receiving
the
parts
/
materials
on
a
timely
basis
because
of
the
issues
that
vendors
may
have
with
us
because
of
recent
enron
events
,
please
let
me
know
.

questar
has
already
informed
us
that
they
would
help
obtain
parts
/
materials
to
our
specifications
if
it
helps
achieve
an
in
-
service
date
of
may
1
.

thanks

listening
to
the
edison
call
w/
investors
edison
says
they
will
pay
everyone
at
the
same
time
(
"
big
bang
"
approach
)
sometime
in
q1
'02
.

my
concern
is
that
between
now
and
then
dunn
,
the
ag
have
the
time
and
resources
to
make
a
heckuvalot
of
mischief
,
which
could
be
detrimental
to
generators
/
marketers
'
claims
.

investors
are
asking
what
edison
intends
for
qfs
and
generators
--
asking
about
haircuts
in
particular
--
and
edison
is
side
-
stepping
the
questions
.

great
.

figured
they
'd
contacted
them
,
but
wanted
to
make
sure
.

you
know
when
the
meeting
with
schedulers
will
be
?

i
apologize
,
i
'm
on
the
road
and
have
n't
heard
when
that
will
be
.

i
'm
thinking
that
i
may
want
to
attend
.

thanks
.

best
,

jeff

probing
the
'
palace
coup
'

electricity
:
a
panel
focuses
on
price
hikes
and
the
actions
of
the
iso

the
orange
county
register

sacramento

a
state
senate
committee
is
set
today
to
start
serving
16
subpoenas
on
electricity
producers
and
officials
who
manage
california
's
energy
grid
to
determine
whether
they
acted
in
concert
to
manipulate
energy
prices
.

the
investigative
committee
,
headed
by
state
sen.
joe
dunn
,
d
-
santa
ana
,
is
focusing
on
a
series
of
events
last
fall
filled
with
enough
shakespearean
plot
twists
and
intrigue
that
it
has
earned
a
name
around
the
capitol
:
"
the
palace
coup
.
"

lawmakers
and
consumer
groups
allege
that
the
events
-
directed
by
the
man
who
heads
the
state
's
energy
grid
-
fueled
the
california
energy
crisis
,
pushed
the
state
into
the
power
-
buying
business
and
helped
make
billions
of
dollars
for
power
producers
.

the
central
question
behind
the
palace
coup
is
whether
terry
winter
,
the
president
of
the
independent
system
operator
,
acted
alone
when
he
took
steps
to
remove
key
price
caps
designed
to
limit
the
amount
power
generators
could
charge
.
